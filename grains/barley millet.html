    <h2>Introdution of barley millet</h2>
    <p>Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago.[3] Globally 70% of barley production is used as animal fodder,[4] while 30% as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation</p>

    <h2> Harvestingn of barley millet </h2>
    <img src="https://5.imimg.com/data5/JN/NR/MY-43324884/foxtail-millets-250x250.jpg">
    <p>Barley crop gets ready for harvest by the end of March to first fortnight of April. Since barley has shattering character, it should be harvested before over ripening to avoid breaking of spikes due to dryness</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Barley thrives well in marginal, saline or alkaline soils and in water scarce areas as rainfed crop. It is also cultivated for malting and brewing purposes in Haryana, Western U.P., Punjab and Rajasthan with relatively better management to get good grain quality.
