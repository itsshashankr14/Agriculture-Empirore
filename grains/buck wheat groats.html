<p>Generally, irrigations are given at an interval of 12-16 days and 4-6 times irrigated with glacial water (Figure 3). The crop grows rapidly and covers the soil very fast. In buckwheat, the higher seed rate is generally used to promote faster canopy development and higher population for better weed control. </p>

    <p>Buckwheat should be harvested when the seeds are mature enough but not ready to fall off. Buckwheat can be harvested by windrowing, when Â¾ of the seeds are mature, or by direct combining, when the lower leaves of the plants have fallen off. When checking for seed maturity, do not count the empty hulls.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
