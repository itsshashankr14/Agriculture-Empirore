    <h2>Introdution of Red rentil</h2>
    <p>Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is one of the
        world's oldest crops having been cultivated in
        southwestern Asia since 7000 BC. The crop is
        best adapted for production in temperate
        climates but is now produced in di</p>
    
        <h2>Health Benefits of </h2>
        <p>● When stacked up against other beans,
            lentils are No. 2 in protein (soybeans
            take top honors). When combined with a
            whole grain, like brown rice.
            ● they can give you the same quality of
            protein as meat. But when you eat
            lentils instead of red or processed meat,you make a healthier choice for your
            heart.
            ● Protein is a building block of bones,
            muscles, and skin. It can also curb your
            appetite because it keeps you feeling
            full longer than other nutrients do</p></br>
        
        
            
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Red rentil </h2>
            <p>Climate Requirement Lentil requires cold
                climate. It is very hardy and can tolerate frost
                and severe winter to a great extent. It require
                cold temperature during its vegetative growth
                and warm temperature at the time of maturity.
                The optimum temperature for growth is
                18-30°C.
                Soil Type and Field Preparation Well drained,
                loam soils with neutral reaction are best for
                lentil cultivation. Acidic soils are not fit for
                growing lentil. The soil should be friable and
                weed free so that seeding could be done at
                uniform depth.Soil Type and Field Preparation Well drained,

<h2> Water Supply for Red rentil</h2>

<p>First irrigation should be given at 40 - 45 days
    of planting and second at pod filling stage.
    Most critical stage for moisture stress is pod
    formation followed by flower initiation. In
    absence of winter rains and where contribution
    of soil moisture is negligible viz . </p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Red rentil </h2>
    <img src="https://www.adascan.ca/wp-content/uploads/saskatchewan-lentils.jpg">
    <p>● when leaves begin to fall, stem and pod
        turn brown or straw in colour and seeds
        are hard and rattle with 15% moisture
        inside them.
        ● The crop should be allowed to dry for
        4-7 days on threshing floor and
        threshed by manually or bullock/power
        drawn thresher.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>● Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are
        largest producers, together producing
        more than 70% of the total. Other major
        producers include West Bengal and
        Bihar.
        ● India is the primary producer of lentils,
        closely followed by Canada.</p>
