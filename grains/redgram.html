            <img src="https://content.peat-cloud.com/thumbnails/direct_seeding-pigeonpea-1583329729.jpg">
            <p>During vegetative growth, prefers a fairly
                moist and warm climate. During flowering and
                ripening stage, requires bright sunny weather
                for proper fruit setting. Highly susceptible to
                frost at the time of flowering, hardy, widely
                adaptable, and drought resistant. It has low
                tolerance of soil salinity and waterlogging.
                Soil requirement for Red Gram Cultivation:
                It thrives in a variety of soil types, from sandy
                loams to clay loams. But loamy soil that is rich
                and well-drained is ideal for it. Soils Pigeon
                pea farming benefits from alluvial and loamy
                 soils that have adequate drainage.</p>

<p> Irrigate immediately after sowing, 3rd day
    after sowing, bud initiation, 50 % flowering and
    pod development stages. Water stagnation
    should be avoided. Harvest the whole plants
    when 80% of the pods mature.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Red gram </h2>

    <p>Redgram is an intermediate growth type and
        thereby the growth is continued with
        reproductive phase. The best time of
        harvesting of the crop is when over 75 per cent
        of pods turn brown. Harvesting may be donewith the help of sickle in Karnataka. After
        harvesting, plants are left in the sun for drying.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
