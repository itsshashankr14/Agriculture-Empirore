            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Green gram</h2>
            <p>Being a leguminous crop gram needs less
                rainfall and having a deep rooted system it
                does very well under dry tracts which receive
                an annual rainfall of 60-100 cm. It prefers fairly
                cold weather but frost is deadly harmful,
                especially at flowering and grain formation
                stages.
                Green gram can be grown on a variety of soils
                ranging from sandy loam to black cotton soils
                having good drainage capacity. Saline and
                alkaline soils are not suitable for green gram
                cultivation. Green gram is very sensitive to
                water logging conditions.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Green gram</h2>
<img src="https://www.digitrac.in/pub/media/magefan_blog/Sprinkler_irrigation_after_cut.jpg">
<p>Irrigate at intervals of 7to 10 days depending
    upon soil and climatic conditions. Flowering
    and pod formation stages are critical periods
    when irrigation is a must. Avoid water
    stagnation at all stages. Apply KCl at 0.5 per
    cent as foliar spray during vegetative stage if
    there is moisture stress.</p>

        the country are Orissa, Maharashtra, Andhra
        Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan
        and Bihar. In Gujarat, it is cultivated in an area
        of about 1.73 lakh hectares with the production
        of 0.72 lakh tonnes with an average yield of
        414 kg/ha (Average of 2004-05)</p>
