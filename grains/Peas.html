    <h2>Introdution of Peas</h2>
    <p>
        A pea is a most commonly green, occasionally
        golden yellow, or infrequently purple
        pod-shaped vegetable, widely grown as a
        cool-season vegetable crop. The seeds may be
        planted as soon as the soil temperature
        reaches 10 °C (50 °F), with the plants growing
        best at temperatures of 13 to 18 °C (55 to 64
        °F)</p>

        <h2>Healthh Benefits of Peas</h2>
        <p>
            ● Good source of plant-based protein.
            Being rich in fibre and one of the best
            plant-based proteins makes peas a
            satisfying component of a meal.
            ● May improve blood sugar management.
            ● May support digestive health.
            ● May support heart health.
            ● May be cancer protective </p></br>
           
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Peas </h2>
            <img src="https://www.agrifarming.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Green-Peas-Farming.jpg">
            <p> O Peas favour a cool climate with an average
                temperature range of 10-18 C during its growth
                period. Seed germination is hampered when
                the temperature at the time of planting is
                below 5°C. Peas can tolerate frost at early
                stages of the growth. However, frost during the
                later stages of crop growth causes
                considerable injury to the newly opened
                flowers and young developing pods. Pods grow
                best in those regions where there is a slow
                transition from cool to warm weather in spring.</p>
                
<h2> Water Supply for Peas</h2>

<p>● If roots are waterlogged for 24 hours,
    the pea plant stomata will close and
    transpiration will stop; if this continues
    for a further 24 hours, then leaves begin
    to desiccate and roots begin to break
    down.
    ● This damage is irreversible and plants
    will exhibit typical foot rot symptoms
    which reduces yield significantly.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Peas </h2>
    <img src="https://a-z-animals.com/media/2023/03/shutterstock_2090649793-1024x683.jpg">
    <p>● Peas are harvested with military
        precision using a state of the art piece
        of kit called a pea viner. The viner gently
        pulls the pea pods from the ground and
        prises the peas from the pod. These
        freshly vined peas are then transported
        to the factory where they are washed,
        blanched and frozen.
        ● Harvest can be done on 75 days after
        sowing. High temperature during
        harvest</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>● Karnataka , Madhya Pradesh ,
        Rajasthan, West Bengal, Punjab, Assam,
        Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
        Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa.
        ● Karnataka has a long history of pea
        cultivation, especially in the northern
        districts of Dharwad and Belagavi.
        Naati Battani, the old local pea cultivar,
        is traditionally used in the dry form.</p>
