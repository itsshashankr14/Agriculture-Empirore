Ideal temperature for green peas cultivation is between 10C to 30C. Above 30C temperature may result in poor yielding. Green Peas cultivation requires soil moisture content @ flowering and pod development stage. Ideal rainfall of 500 mm required for its crop growth.Green Peas can be cultivated in wide variety of soils. However they grow best in well-drained soils with pH range of 6 to 8. Soils with good organic matter will result in good yield and quality of peas. Appropriate rotten Farm Yard Manure (F.M.Y) can be applied at the time of land preparation. To find any deficiency nutrient values in soil, one should perform soil test before planning the cultivation.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Greenpeas</h2>
<p>Frequent irrigation should be carried out in green peas cultivation, again it all depends on season. If it’s rainy season, low intervals of irrigation required.
