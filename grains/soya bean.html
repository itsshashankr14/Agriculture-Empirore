    <h2>Introdution of soya beans</h2>
    <p>Soybeans are legumes related to peas, clover and alfalfa. Soybeans are dicots, which means they have two cotyledons. Each soybean plant produces 60 to 80 pods, each holding three pea-sized beans. Soybeans are hardy plants and well adapted to a variety of soils and soil conditions.</p>
        <h2>Health Benefits of soya bean</h2>

        <p>Soybeans and soy foods may reduce the risk of a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and some cancers, as well as improving bone health. Soy is a high-quality protein one or 2 daily serves of soy products can be beneficial to our health</p>
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for soya beans</h2>
            <p>Soybean grows well in warm and moist climate. A temperature of 26 to 30°C appears to be the optimum for most of the varieties. Soil temperatures of 15.5°C or above favor rapid germination and vigorous seedling growth. A lower temperature tends to delay the flowering.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for soya bean</h2>

<p>Soybean uses very little water during the seedling stage. Estimates for total consumptive water use from emergence through V6 is about 3.0 inches. Unless the soil is extremely dry, supplemental irrigation is generally not needed during germination or the vegetative growth stages.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of soya bean</h2>

    <p> The season of harvesting of Soybean depends on the time of sowing and the variety grown such as short duration or long duration. Generally, Kharif Soybean is harvested during the period October  November and Rabi crops harvested in the month of January February.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Production of soybean in India is dominated by Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh which contribute 89 per cent of the total production. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat contribute the remaining 11 per cent production. Mahrashtra has the potential of becoming the leader in Soybean.<p>
