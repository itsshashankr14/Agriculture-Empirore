    <h2>Introdution of Chik pea</h2>
    <p>Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an ancient crop
        first taken into cultivation by Neolithic farmers.
        Today, chickpea continues to play an
        important role in agricultural systems in the
        world, ranking third behind dry bean
        (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and field pea (Pisum
        sativum L.) in terms of grain legume
        production</p>

        <h2>Healthh Benefits of Chik pea</h2>
        <p>Chickpeas are high in dietary fiber, especially
            a soluble fiber called raffinose. The good
            bacteria in your gut breaks this down so your
            colon can digest it slowly. Studies have found
            that eating more chickpeas can help make
            bowel movements easier and more regular.
            They can help lower cholesterol. </p></br>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Chik pea </h2>
            <p>Chickpea, being a winter season crop requires
                cool climate for its growth and development,
                while it requires relatively high temperture at
                maturity. Severe cold and frost at the time of
                flowering cause flower drop. The optimum
                temperature for its growth ranges from 15 -
                250 C.

                cool climate for its growth and development,
                while it requires relatively high temperture at

                Soil required
                Suitable soil type: Chickpea can be
                successfully grown in a variety of soil types
                including coarse-textured sandy to
                fine-textured deep black soils (vertisols).
                However, the best suited soils are deep loams
                or silty clay loams with a pH ranging from 6.0
                to 8.0.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Chik pea</h2>

<p>Pre-irrigate or water-up to fill the soil profile
    wherever possible. Irrigate early at 60-70% of
    field capacity to avoid crop stress and soil
    cracking open. Irrigated chickpea crops can
    be very profitable and rewarding with well
    managed crops yielding in excess of 3.5 t/ha </p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Chik pea </h2>

    <p>Chickpeas can be harvested when the majority
        of the plants are yellow and most pods are
        mature (yellow to brown in colour). At this
        stage, the top of the plant may still be green.
        However, if the plants are left standing too
        long following maturity there is a risk of pod
        drop.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Chickpea producing states in India are:
        Madhya Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh. Rajasthan.</p>
