    <h2>Introdution of Black gram</h2>
    <p>The pulse 'Black gram' plays an important role
        in Indian diet, as it contains vegetable protein
        and supplement to cereal based diet. It
        contains about 26% protein, which is almost
        three times that of cereals and other minerals
        and vitamins. Besides, it is also used as
        nutritive fodder, specially for milch animals.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Peas </h2>
            <p>● It is generally grown in kharif/rainy and
                summer season.
                ● It grows best in hot and humid
                condition with ideal temperature range
                between 25 to 35oC.
                ● It can be grown successfully from sea
                level up to an elevation of 1800 meters.
                ● Heavy rains during flowering are
                harmful.
                Black gram can be grown on variety of soils
                ranging from sandy soils to heavy cotton soils .
                The most ideal soil is a well drained loam with
                pH of 6.5 to 7.8. Black gram cannot be grown
                on alkaline and saline soils. Land is prepared
                like any other kharif season pulse crop.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Black gram</h2>

<p>Irrigate at intervals of 7to 10 days depending
    upon soil and climatic conditions. Flowering
    and pod formation stages are critical periods
    when irrigation is a must. Avoid water
    stagnation at all stages </p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Black gram</h2>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSJSjJ3r3qCWsnOkUfyU0sCMYL_UZ02Ef5fiw&usqp=CAU">
    <p>Harvesting, Threshing & Storage
        Urd should be harvested when 70-80 % pods
        matured and most of the pods turn black. Over
        maturity may result in shattering. Harvested
        crop should be dried on threshing floor for few
        days and then threshed. Threshing can be done
        either manually or by trampling under the feet
        of bullocks.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra
        Pradesh are major blackgram growing states
        area-wise. The highest yield was recorded by
        the state of Bihar (898 kg/ha) followed by
        Sikkim (895 kg/ha) and Jharkhand (890
        kg/ha). The National yield average is 585
        kg/ha.</p>
