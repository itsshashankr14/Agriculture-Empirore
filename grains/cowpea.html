    <h2>Introdution of Cow pea</h2>
    <p>cowpea, (Vigna unguiculata), also called
        black-eyed pea or southern pea, annual plant
        within the pea family (Fabaceae) grown for its
        edible legumes. The plants are thought to be
        native to West Africa and are widely cultivated
        in warm regions around the world</p>

        <h2> Health Benefits of Cow pea </h2>
        <p>Regular consumption of cowpeas reduces LDL
            and total cholesterol levels and improves blood
            circulation and heart health. Cowpeas have a
            low glycaemic index, thus reducing sudden
            spikes of blood sugar levels after eating.
            Therefore, including them in the diet is
            beneficial for diabetic people.</p></br>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Cowpea </h2>
            <p>Cowpea is warm weather and semi arid crop,
                where temperature ranging from 20 OC to 30
                OC . Minimum temperature for seed
                establishment is 20 OC and above 32 OC
                temperatures development Page 2 of root is
                cease. For maximum production day
                temperature 27 OC and night temperature 22
                OC required.
                ell drained loam or slightly heavy soil are best
                suited. In colder climate somewhat sandy soil
                preferred as crop mature earlier in them. It
                can grow successfully in acidic soil but not in
                saline/alkaline soil. In hard soil, one deep
                ploughing followed by two or three harrowing
                and planking are sufficient</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Cow pea </h2>

<p>● Irrigate immediately after sowing
    ● Life irrigation on the third day.
    ● Irrigate at intervals of 7 to 10 days
    depending upon soil and climatic
    conditions.
    ● Flowering and pod formation stages are
    critical periods when irrigation is a
    must. Avoid water stagnation at all
    stages. .
    ● Apply KCl at 0.5 per cent as foliar spray
    during vegetative stage if there is
    moisture stress</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Cow pea </h2>
    <img src="https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/seed_certification/images/seed%20images/cowepa/harvesting.png">
    <p>Green pods for use as vegetable can be
        harvested 45-90 days after sowing depending
        on the variety. For grains, the crop can be
        harvested in about 90-125 days after sowing
        when pods are fully matured. The crop should
        be then dried and threshed, threshed grain
        should be dried in sun before storage.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>In Indian context, it is a minor pulse cultivated
        mainly in arid and semi arid tracts of grown in
        pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and West
        UP along with considerable area in Rajasthan,
        Karnataka, Kerala, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra
        and Gujarat</p>
