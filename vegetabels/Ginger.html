    <h2>Introdution of Ginger</h2>
    <p>Indians and Chinese are believed to have produced ginger as a tonic root for over 5000 years to treat many ailments, and this plant is now cultivated throughout the humid tropics, with India being the largest producer. Ginger was used as a flavoring agent long before history was formally recorded.However, this might not be a safe or advisable practice. For example, at least one recent survey revealed a significant.problemwithherb-chemotherapeutic drug interactions in cancer patients and, notably, at least half of the herbal remedies taken by these patients lacked research.</p>

            Ginger is made from a flowering plant originating in Southeast Asia. Including ginger in your diet can have numerous physical and psychological health benefits.Ginger is among the healthiest (and most delicious) spices on the planet. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, and it’s closely related to turmeric, cardamom, and galangal.The rhizome (underground part of the stem) is the part commonly used as a spice. It’s often called ginger root or, simply, ginger.Ginger can be used fresh, dried, powdered, or as an oil or juice. It’s a very common ingredient in recipes. It’s sometimes added to processed foods and cosmetics.

            <h2>Different type of  Ginger</h2>
            <img src="https://grandroyalspices.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ginger-1.jpg">
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for  Ginger</h2>
            <p>Ginger grows well in warm and humid climate and is cultivated from sea level to an altitude of 1500 m above sea level. Ginger can be grown both under rain fed and irrigated conditions. For successful cultivation of the crop, a moderate rain fall at sowing time till the rhizomes sprout, fairly heavy and well distributed showers during the growing period and dry weather for about a month before harvesting are necessary. Ginger thrives best in well drained soils like sandy loam, clay loam, red loam or lateritic loam. A friable loam rich in humus is ideal. However, being an exhausting crop it is not desirable to grow ginger in the same soil year after year.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for  Ginger</h2>
<p>Ginger is cultivated as rain fed crop in high rainfall areas (uniform distribution for 5 to 7 months) and irrigated crop in less rainfall areas where distribution is not uniform. Ginger requires 1300-1500 mm of water during its crop cycle. The critical stages for irrigation are during germination, rhizome initiation (90 DAP) and rhizome development stages (135 DAP). The first irrigation should be done immediately after planting and subsequent irrigations are given at intervals of 7 to 10 days in conventional irrigation (based on prevailing weather and soil type).Sprinklers and drip system can also be employed for better water use efficiency and enhanced yield.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of  Ginger</h2>
    <img src="https://justgardenthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-grow-ginger-plus-its-amazing-health-benefits.jpg">
    <p>Ginger attains full maturity in 210-240 days after planting. Harvesting of ginger for vegetable purpose starts after 180 days based on the demand. However, for making dry ginger, the matured rhizomes are harvested at full maturity i.e. when the leaves turn yellow and start drying. Irrigation is stopped one month before harvest and the rhizome clumps are lifted carefully with a spade or digging fork. In large scale cultivations, tractor or power tiller drawn harvesters are also used. The dry leaves, roots and soil adhering on the rhizomes are manually separated. Late harvest is also practiced, as the crop does not deteriorate by leaving it for some months underground. In India, domestic market prefers fresh green ginger for culinary use while two types of dried ginger i.e. bleached and unbleached are produced for export purpose. The most important criteria in assessing the suitability of ginger rhizomes for particular processing purposes is the fibre content, volatile-oil content and the pungency level. The relative abundance of these three components in the fresh rhizome is governed by its state of maturity at harvest.</p>

        Kerala,Karnataka,NPK ,Full P and half K applied as basal dose in furrows before planting and N and K in 2 splits at 45 and 90 DAP.MeghalayaAs the soil fertility will be varying with the soil type, agro ecological conditions or management systems, site specific nutrient management based on the soil test results for major nutrient is advocated.
