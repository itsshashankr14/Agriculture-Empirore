    <h2>Introdution of Potato</h2>
    <p>Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the most important food crop of the world. Potato is a temperate crop grown under subtropical conditions in India. The potato is a crop which has always been the 'poor man's friend'. Potato is being cultivated in the country for the last more than 300 years.
        Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas by the Spanish in the second half of the 16th century. Today they are a staple food in many parts.

        <h2>Health Benefits of Potato</h2>

        <p>Potatoes for health and nutrition
            They're rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant. Potatoes were a life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C prevented scurvy. Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an electrolyte which aids in the workings of our heart, muscles, and nervous system.
            There seems to be a lot of misconceptions on the health benefits of potatoes. UC Davis Health dietetic intern Adrienne Posner breaks down the nutrition facts on potatoes and why you may want to serve them at your next meal.

            <h2>Different type of Potato</h2>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Potato</h2>
            <p>Potato is a temperate climate crop, however it grows under a diverse range of climatic conditions. It is grown only under such conditions where the temperature during the growing seasons is moderately cool. The vegetative growth of the plant is best at a temperature of 24°C while tuber development is favoured at 20°C. Hence, potato is grown as a summer crop in the hills and as a winter crop in the tropical and subtropical regions. The crop can be raised up to an altitude of 3000 m above the sea level.The potato can be grown almost on any type of soil except saline and alkaline soils. Soils, which are naturally loose, offer least resistance to the enlargement of the tubers is preferred. Loamy and sandy loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration are most suitable for cultivation of potato crop. The soil with pH range of 5.2-6.4 is considered to be ideal.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Potato</h2>

<p>Irrigation has a special significance in the potato production as the plant has shallow and sparse root system. First irrigation should be light and given 5-7 days after planting and subsequent irrigation are given at 7-15 days interval depending upon the climatic condition and soil type. The drip system of irrigation is most economical giving highest productivity and saving almost 50% water. It also enables application of fertilizers through irrigation water. The sprinkler system gives uniform distribution of water and reduces water losses by percolation and run off. Sprinkler irrigation is beneficial on frosty nights as it reduces frost damage in potatoes. It is recommended for areas with undulating topography, extremely sandy soil and scarce water supply. Under such situations, the use of sprinkler systems increases water use efficiency by 40% as compared to furrow irrigation.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Potato</h2>

    <p>
        The time of harvest is very important in potato. The development of tuber continues till vines die. The main crop is ready for harvest within 75-120 days of planting depending upon the area, soil type and variety sown. In the hills, the crop should be normally harvested when the soil is not very wet. Tubers lifted during the monsoon have a poor keeping quality and also develop various types of rots. The main crop is ready for harvest when majority of the leaves turn yellow-brown. At this stage, the tops are cut near the ground level. The potatoes are dug out from the field by ploughing after 8-10 days. These potatoes are manually picked from the field and stored in shade. Manual harvesting of potatoes is very labour intensive, time consuming and causes lot of damage to the tubers. Various low cost bullock drawn and tractor drawn potato diggers have been developed at CPRI, Shimla which exposes 80% of the tubers and covers 1-3 ha of area per day.

    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native.
        The potato is native to the Peruvian-Bolivian Andes. It was cultivated in South America by the Incas as early as 1,800 years ago. The Spaniards who colonized South America introduced potatoes into Europe during the second half of the 16th century.
