    <h2>Introdution of Carrot </h2>
    <p>Carrot is a biennial, belonging to the family Apiaceae, and is an important vegetable for its fleshy edible, colorful roots. It varies in colour from white, yellow, orange, light purple, deep red to deep violet.
        The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist,[2][3][4] all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.

            In addition to simple and healthy methods, enjoying healthy root vegetables has many health benefits.Carrots (Daucus carota L) are one of the most widely used and most important tubers in the world, also because they are relatively easy to grow, are widely used in various dishes and cultural cuisine, and have different colors, such as orange, purple and white. , Yellow and red. The main root of carrots is the most commonly consumed part of vegetables, although vegetables can still be used in salads and other forms.

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Carrot</h2>
            <p>Carrot is a cool season crop and will develop a good colour when grown at 15°C to 20°C. The crop needs deep loose loamy soil. It requires a pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.0 for higher production. Carrot can be grown throughout the year at an elevation above 1500 metres with assured irrigation.Carrots thrive when soil pH is neutral to slightly acidic, between 6 and 7. Good soil for growing well-shaped roots is a light sandy loam. Heavier clay soils are fine as long as the soil is well-drained and not compacted. Grow parsnips in sandy, loamy soils, not heavy clay or silt soils.Most parsnip varieties grow quite long, and they taper from a thick top to a narrow end. Shallow, heavy or rocky soils are not good for growing parsnips. If your garden has deep, sandy, loam soil, you should be able to grow a satisfying crop of parsnips.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Carrot</h2>

<p>Carrots are usually irrigated using furrow irrigation. However, it is quite common for growers to use sprinklers for germination. The use of sprinklers helps to reduce the amount of water needed which reduces the potential for salts to enter the seed row and cause emergence problems.Carrots are nutritious root vegetables that are easy to grow in a home garden. They do well when planted early in the spring while the ground is still cool, especially when placed in well-drained soil in a sunny spot. Irrigating your planting bed can provide carrot plants with the steady, uniform water supply they require, helping to ensure a good crop at harvest time.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Carrot</h2>

    <p>Carrots should be ready for harvest about 60-80 days after sowing seeds, depending on the variety. The tops of the carrot roots will be about 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter and likely starting to pop out of the soil, though not necessarily.Carrots should be ready for harvest about 60-80 days after sowing seeds, depending on the variety. The tops of the carrot roots will be about 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter and likely starting to pop out of the soil, though not necessarily. They will also be vibrant in color. To harvest, loosen soil around the carrot with a spade or trowel before pulling up from the greens; this will help avoid breaking the greens off from the carrot roots.</p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Carrots prefer sunny locations (6 to 10 hours of sun). The soil itself should be free-draining; this is one of the few crops that actively benefits from sandier soils. You don't want your soil to be too rich either or the carrots can't reach down.</p>
