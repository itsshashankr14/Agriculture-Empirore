    <h2>Introdution of Eggplant</h2>
    <p>Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is a member of the family Solanaceae and is botanically related to tomato, pepper and potato. Eggplants are native to India and China but were introduced to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region by Arabic traders.

        The standard eggplant is an oval or pear-shaped, glossy, purplish fruit 6 to 9 inches long. Japanese and oriental varieties tend to be elongated and slender with a thinner, more delicate skin. "Ornamental" varieties are edible and tend to produce small, white-skinned, oval-shaped fruit.eggplant, (Solanum melongena), also called aubergine or Guinea squash, tender perennial plant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), grown for its edible fruits. Eggplant requires a warm climate and has been cultivated in its native Southeast Asia since remote antiquity.    </p>
        <h2>Health Benefits of Eggplant</h2>

        <p>Eggplant has antioxidants like vitamins A and C, which help protect your cells against damage. It's also high in natural plant chemicals called polyphenols, which may help cells do a better job of processing sugar if you have diabetes.The eggplant has been an ingredient in traditional medicine for thousands of years. In the ancient Indian system of ayurvedic medicine, practitioners used white eggplant to treat diabetes and the roots to relieve asthma.
            While eggplant isn't the most nutritious vegetable, it does give you a decent supply of potassium and fiber. And at just 25 calories and less than 1 gram of fat per serving, it's a pretty guilt-free food -- as long as you don't soak it in oil. </p></br>
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Eggplant</h2>
            <p>The fruit is generally harvested when half grown, and used in its immature stage. Eggplant is subject to chilling if stored at tempera tures below 4°C. Optimum temperatures for storage are 7° to 10°C, and 90% relative humidity.Eggplant prefers soil that's on the acidic, or low-pH side. A home soil test kit or soil test meter can determine your soil's pH level. If it is higher than 6.5, add about 1 pound of sulfur per 100 square feet for every point by which you need to lower the pH.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Eggplant</h2>

<p>Experiments assessed the effects of irrigation rate on plant growth and fruit yield in eggplant. Plants irrigated at 67 percent ETc produced fruit yields similar to those of plants irrigated at 100 percent ETc or higher rates, suggesting that eggplant may tolerate mild water stressAccording to Utah State University, the proper irrigation plan for eggplants, is to apply 2.5-5cm water (1-2 inches per week). Of course, water requirements can be totally different under different weather and soil conditions. For example, heavy clay soils normally need less irrigation than a sandy soil.Eggplant crop prefers balanced soil humidity regime, not lower than 60 % of the range of available water content, being however not higher than the normal field capacity of soil ( below 90 % moisture ceiling of AWC).</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Eggplant</h2>

    <p>Eggplants are delicious and healthy vegetables that are easy to grow right at home. If you’ve got a crop of eggplant coming in, it’s important to know exactly when to harvest them since eggplants can over ripen easily. Once they’re ready, all you need to do is cut them from the stem. Eggplants generally keep for 1-2 weeks after harvesting, as long as you store them properly.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Eggplants (Solanum melongena) grow wild in South Asia as a perennial plant, but these warm-season vegetables are treated by most North American gardeners as annuals.</p>
