    <h2>Introdution of </h2>
    <p>beet, (Beta vulgaris), also called beetroot, common beet, or garden beet, one of the four cultivated forms of the plant Beta vulgaris of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), grown for its edible leaves and taproot. Beetroots are frequently roasted or boiled and served as a side dish.They are also commonly canned, either whole or cut up, and often are pickled, spiced, or served in a sweet-and-sour sauce. The leaves of garden beets can be cooked like spinach or eaten fresh if picked young. Beetroots are a good source of riboflavin as well as folate, manganese, and the antioxidant betaine.</p>
    Beta vulgaris is an edible plant of the Amaranthaceae family. Its common name is beet and it is distributed throughout Asia Minor, the Mediterranean, and Europe (Kumar et al., 2016). Beets have been used in folk medicines all over the world for different reasons.first recorded in 1542. Its earliest form more closely resembled a parsnip rather than the bulbous shape we're now familiar with, which began appearing near the end of the 1500s

            <h2>Different type of BEETROOT </h2>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for BEETROOT </h2>
            <p>Optimum temperatures for growth and development are 15°C to 18°C, with mean minimums of 5°C and mean maximums of 24°C. Although beetroot is a cool-season crop, it is fairly tolerant to high temperatures, provided that soil moisture is adequate. The plant can withstand moderate frosts, but growth will be affected.Beetroot is essentially a cool weather crop but it can be grown in a moderately warm climate as it attains best colour, texture and quality in a cool weather condition. A temperature range of 18-21°C is considered as ideal for obtaining good quality roots, rich in sugar with intense red colour.Beetroot can be grown on a wide range of soils, but best results are obtained on well-drained sandy to loamy soils, with optimum pH 6 to 8. Hard, compacted soils should be avoided, as they impede seedling emergence and symmetrical root development.</p>
<h2> Water Supply  for BEETROOT</h2>
<p>Beetroot have shallow roots. They usually stay in the top 300mm layer of soil. Growers must take care that this layer does not dry out. From planting stage irrigation must be calculated so that the whole 300mm depth is wet. The interval between irrigation cycles will vary according to the soil type and climate. Water consumption will be faster during warm days and cycles made shorter to ensure good water supply to the plants. During colder months the intervals are longer.Beetroot requires 4 mm of rain water per day during average summer day but 2mm during a winter’s day. On very hot summer days 8mm may be required. Most growers apply 20-30mm of water per irrigation cycle. The best is to consult an irrigation specialist to calculate the water retention capacity of the soil. In that way precise irrigation cycles can be calculated.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of BEETROOT </h2>
    <img src="https://gardenerspath.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Harvesting-Beets.jpg">
    <p>Harvesting. Beetroots can be harvested from early summer through to mid-autumn, depending on sowing time and variety. Loosen the soil with a hand fork, then pull up alternate plants once the roots reach golf-ball size, leaving the rest to grow to maturity if you wish. Harvest these when no larger than a cricket ball.To determine whether they are ready to be harvested, clear away some of the mulch or soil around the top of your beets and look for crowns protruding above the soil line. If you can see an inch or two sticking out above the soil, it's a safe bet that they are ready for pullingFirst, it's important to point out that beets are a biennial crop that are grown as annuals. These root vegetables grow in full sun or partial shade. They can be harvested for two different edible portions: their leaves and their roots.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>The beet (Beta vulgaris) is a flowering plant in the family Chenopodiaceae, native to the coasts of western and southern Europe, from southern Sweden and the British Isles south to the Mediterranean Sea. It is important because of its cultivated varieties, fodder beet, beetroot and the sugar-producing sugar beet.</p>
