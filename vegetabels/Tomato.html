    <h2>Introdution of Tomato </h2>
    <p>Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) belongs to the genus Lycopersicon under Solanaceae family. 
        Tomato is a herbaceous sprawling plant growing to 1-3 m in height with weak woody stem. The 
        flowers are yellow in colour and the fruits of cultivated varieties vary in size from cherry 
        tomatoes, about 1–2 cm in size to beefsteak tomatoes, about 10 cm or more in diameter. Most 
        cultivars produce red fruits when ripe. Tomato is a native to Peruvian and Mexican region. 
        Though there are no definite records of when and how it came to India , the Portuguese perhaps 
        introduced it to India.The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century

        <h2>Health Benefits of Tomato </h2>
        <p>Heart Heart disease — including heart attacks and strokes — is the world’s most common cause of death.
            A study in middle-aged men linked low blood levels of lycopene and beta-carotene to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).
            Increasing evidence from clinical trials suggests that supplementing with lycopene may help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol (29Trusted Source).
            Clinical studies of tomato products indicate benefits against inflammation and markers of oxidative stress (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).
            They also show a protective effect on the inner layer of blood vessels and may decrease your risk of blood clotting

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for tomato </h2>
            <p>The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also light intensity affects pigmentation, fruit colour, fruit set. The plant is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions. It requires different climatic range for seed germination, seedling growth, flower and fruit set, and fruit quality. Temperature below 100C and above 380C adversely affects plant tissues thereby slow down physiological activities. It thrives well in temperature 100C to 300C with optimum range of temperature is 21-240C. The mean temperature below 160C and above 270C are not desirable. The plant doesn't withstand frost, it requires low to medium rainfall, and does well under average monthly temperature of 21 to 230C. Avoid water stress and long dry period as it causes cracking of fruits. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to develop dark red coloured fruits.Tomato can be grown on a wide range of soils from sandy to heavy clay. However, well-drained, sandy or red loam soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 are considered as ideal.Tomato is a warm season crop. The best fruit colour and quality is obtained at a temperature range of 21-24°C. Temperatures above 32o C adversely affects the fruit set and development. The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. It requires a low to medium rainfall. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to develop dark red coloured fruits. Temperature below 10 oC adversely affects plant tissues thereby slowing down physiological activities.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Tomato</h2>
<img src="https://plantophiles.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Overwatered-Tomatoes-720x405.jpg.webp">
<p> Tomato is very sensitive to water application. Heavy irrigation provided after a long spell of drought causes cracking of the fruits. Hence it should be avoided. Light irrigation should be given 3-4 days after transplanting. Irrigation intervals should be according to soil type and rainfall, irrigation should be given 7-8 days interval during kharif, during rabi 10-12 days and 5-6 days during summer.

    Flowering and fruit development are the critical stages of tomato therefore; water stress should not be given during this period.
    On an average, tomatoes require 1-1.2 inches of water in a week. For proper watering, farms are equipped with sprinklers, drip and flooding techniques that satisfy the plant's needs.
    A drip irrigation system is one of the most effective ways to water tomato plants. For this method, water is run through small tubes placed at the base of each plant. It's effective because the water is delivered right to the roots of the plant.

    <h2> Harvestingn of Tomato</h2>
    <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tomato-picking-royalty-free-image-1589924812.jpg">
    <p>Depending on the variety, fruits become ready for first picking in about 60-70 days after transplanting. The stage of harvesting depends upon the purpose to which the fruits are to be used. The different stages of harvesting are as follows-

        Dark green colour - Dark green colour is changed and a reddish pink shade is observed on fruit. Fruits to be shipped are harvested at this stage. Such fruits are then sprayed with ethylene 48 hours prior to shipping. Immature green tomatoes will ripen poorly and be of low quality. A simple way to determine maturity is to slice the tomato with a sharp knife. If seeds are cut, the fruit is too immature for harvest and will not ripen properly.Breaker stage - Dim pink colour observed on ¼ part of the fruit. Fruits are harvested at this stage to ensure the best quality. Such fruit are less prone to damage during shipment often fetch a higher price than less mature tomatoes.Pink stage - Pink colour observed on ¾ part of the fruit.Reddish pink- Fruits are stiff and nearly whole fruit turns reddish pink. Fruits for local sale are harvested at this stage.Fully riped - Fruits are fully riped and soft having dark red colour. Such fruits are used for processing.

    <h2> Location</h2>
    <p>Devote a prime, sunny spot to growing tomatoes. Tomatoes need at least 6 to 8 hours of sun to bring out their best flavors. You will need to stake, trellis, or cage most tomato plants to keep them off the ground. Decide on a support plan before you set out your plants, then add that support directly after planting.Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are tender perennials, hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 through 11. Following established tomato growing tips can improve the size, quality and quantity of fruit that your plants can produce. The factors that influence the success of your tomatoes include Containers-8-qt/34621245?athbdg=L1102" target="_blank" rel="nofollow,noopener">soil type, exposure, spacing and proximity to other plants.</p>
