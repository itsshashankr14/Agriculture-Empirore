    <h2>Introdution of Beans </h2>
    <p>A bean is the seed of several plants in the family Fabaceae, which are used as vegetables for human or animal food. They can be cooked in many different ways, including boiling, frying, and baking, and are used in many traditional dishes throughout the world.
        Beans are one of the longest-cultivated plants in history. Broad beans, also called fava beans, are in their wild state the size of a small fingernail, and were first gathered in Afghanistan and the Himalayan foothills.[9] An early cultivated form were grown in Thailand from the early seventh millennium BCE, predating ceramics.[10] Beans were deposited with the dead in ancient Egypt. Not until the second millennium BCE did cultivated, large-seeded broad beans appear in the Aegean region, Iberia, and transalpine Europe.[11] In the Iliad (8th century BCE), there is a passing mention of beans and chickpeas cast on the threshing floor.

        <h2>Health Benefits of Beans </h2>
        <p>The nutrients in beans can provide significant health benefits. The antioxidants found in beans can help reduce cell damage caused by free radicals. This can lower your risk of cancer, sagging skin, and other signs of aging. Darker-colored beans have more of these antioxidants because they have more of the pigments that contain them. 
            Other health benefits of beans include:
            •Lots of Fiber. 
            •Beans are a great source of fiber. 
            •Plenty of Protein.
            •Keeps You at a Healthy Weight. 
            •Boosts Your Heart Health. 
            •A Good Food for Diabetes Control. 
            •Great Source of Iron.
            •Provides Magnesium.
            •Chock-Full of Potassium.

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Beans </h2>
            <p>The climatic condition required for Beans plantation: Common Indian beans grow within a range of temperatures of 17.5-27°C requires a cold climatic condition. Temperature above 30°C may cause the bean flower buds to fall and in temperatures above 35°C, been seeds might not form.
                This economic evaluation refers to the investment in the Managing Climate Variability Program (MCVP) Phases II and III. The aim of the program is to help primary industries and natural resource managers manage the risks and exploit the opportunities afforded by Australita’s variable and changing climate by: improving forecasting accuracy, lead-time and ease of use, providing tools.
                Beans grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil, pH between 6 and 7. Clay or silt loams are better for bean production than sandy soils, although good drainage is important. Use well-rotted manure or compost at planting to increase soil organic matter.
 Best Soils

Most beans aren't too choosy about where they'll sink their roots. They'll give you a good crop in soil that's loamy, sandy, rocky, rich or poor and even in clay. But avoid planting beans in the shade or in soil that stays wet and doesn't drain well. Bean diseases thrive in wet conditions, and the roots may not get enough oxygen with water and mud clogging their air channels.

<h2> Water Supply for Beans </h2>

<p>Moving and pressurising water requires a lot of energy. As a result irrigation is the major energy user in growing vegetables. For most growers, improving productivity, i.e. increasing the revenue for the amount of energy used, is more important to the bottom-line than simply improving the energy efficiency and reducing energy costs. Managing irrigation well.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Beans </h2>
    <img src="https://gardenerspath.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gardener-Harvesting-Snap-Beans-from-the-Garden.jpg">
    <p>Beans should be ready to harvest as soon as 65 days after planting. When beans are ready to harvest, the seeds inside the pod are not quite full size. Harvestable beans should snap easily off the plant, and stored in airtight containers for up to four days after harvest.
        There are two main kinds of beans found in gardens, bush beans and pole beans, commonly known as green beans. The main difference between the two is the growing style – bush beans don’t require support as they grow whereas pole beans grow in a vining fashion and require stakes or trellises. Bush beans require less maintenance, though pole beans are disease resistant and produce more crop.
