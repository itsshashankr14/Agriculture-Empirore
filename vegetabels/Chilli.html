            <p>
                Chilli can be grown in all type of soils, but the sandy - loam, clay loam and loamy soils with pH of 5.5 to 7 are best suited for chilli.
                The soil must be well drained and well aerated. Acidic soils are not suitable for chilli cultivation.The chilli is a plant of tropical and sub -tropical region, it grows well in warm and humid climate and a temperature of 200C to 250C. As a rain fed crop, it is grown in areas receiving an annual rainfall of 25-30 inches.
                Chillies need your warmest, sunniest spot to produce a crop outdoors. They grow well in large containers, ideally on a sunny patio or by a south-facing wall. They can also be planted in the ground, into well-drained, fertile, moisture-retentive soil that is slightly acid.

    irrigation is not required if timely rains are received during rainy season.
    But under dry spell one to two irrigation may be given by opening furrows between the rows.
    In case of rabi crop irrigations are given at 15 to 20 days interval.

    <p>To harvest chillies cut them off the plant with scissors or a sharp knife. Chillies can be harvested when they are green or red, however, there are some varieties that will not turn red in our climate. If your plant has unripe chillies, you can ripen them off the plant.Harvesting and yield: The crop starts yielding green chillies 2 months after transplanting and dry chillies 90 days after transplanting. The crop lasts for 5-6 months after transplanting depending upon duration of the variety. Four to five picking of green chillies or two to three picking of red ripe chillies is done.Simply wash and pat dry your chillies, cut off the tops then roughly chop, keeping the seeds in. Next mix the chopped chillies with 30g salt and place in a sterilised glass jar. Cover the surface with remaining salt then seal the jar and store in a cool, dry place for a couple of weeks before refrigerating.</p>
