    <h1>CABBAGE</h1>

    <h2>Introdution of Cabbage</h2>
    <p>Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var capitata) is a small, leafy biennial producing a compact globular mass of smooth or crincled leaves wrapped over each other known as head. The outer leaves are generally larger than the inner. The stem is short and stout. Plants flower generally after winter.
        A cabbage generally weighs between 500 and 1,000 grams (1 and 2 lb). Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer. Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large. As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138 lb 4 oz).

        <h2> Health Benefits of Cabbage</h2>

        <p>Cabbage is highly nutritious and rich in vitamin C, fiber, and vitamin K. Whatâ€™s more, some research suggests that it may support digestion, improve heart health, and decrease inflammation.
            Despite its impressive nutrient content, cabbage is often overlooked.
            While it may look a lot like lettuce, it actually belongs to the Brassica genus of vegetables, which includes broccoli, radishes, and Brussels sprouts (1Trusted Source).
            It comes in a variety of shapes and colors, including red, purple, white, and green, and its leaves can be either crinkled or smooth.

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Cabbage</h2>
            <p>Cultivation of cabbage is done mainly on sandy to heavy soils rich in organic matter. Early crops prefer light soil while late crops thrive better on heavier soils due to retention of moisture. On heavy soils, plants grow more slowly and the keeping quality is improved. A pH range of 6.0-6.5 is considered as optimum for growing cabbage. Plants growing in saline soils are prone to diseases.It comes in a variety of shapes and colors, including red, purple, white, and green, and its leaves can.A pH range of 6.0-6.5 is considered as optimum for growing cabbage.

                In India, cabbage is grown in large areas having a cool and moist climate. A temperature range of 15o-21o C is considered as optimum for growth and head formation of the crop. The intensity of flowering depends upon the age of the plants and the period for which they are exposed to low temperatures.

<h2> Water Supply for Cabbage </h2>

<p>First irrigation is given just after transplanting of seedlings and subsequent irritations are given at an interval of 10-15 days depending upon the season and soil conditions. Care should be taken to avoid water stress from the time of head formation to the head maturity period. At the time of crop maturity, irrigation should be avoided as excess irrigation at this stage causes splitting of heads.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Cabbage</h2>

    <p>Harvesting immature heads, however, reduces yield, and the heads are too soft to resist handling damage. Immature heads also have a shorter shelf life than mature heads.

        The head is harvested by bending it to one side and cutting it with a knife. The stalk should be cut flat and as close to the head as possible, yet long enough to retain two to four wrapper leaves. Extra leaves act as cushions during handling and may be desired in certain markets. The head should not be removed by snapping or twisting it since this practice damages the head and results in inconsistent stalk length. Broken stalks are also more susceptible to decay. As the heads are not ready for harvest at the same time, therefore they are harvested in stages based on the maturity of the heads.
        Harvested produce should always be stored in shade before packing.
