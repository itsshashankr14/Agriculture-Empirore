    <h1>CAPSICUM</h1>

    <h2>Introdution of Capsicum</h2>
    <p>  Capsicums (Capsicum annuum) and chillies (Capsicum frutescens) originate from South and Central America. They are members of the Solanaceae family, as are tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant. Plants are bushy, about 60–80cm high and semi-perennials that are grown as annuals in commercial cultivation.The term chilli refers to fruit which is usually cone-shaped and smaller and the pungency may be mild to intensely hot. The main compound responsible for pungency is capsaicin. Within a chilli variety, the greatest pungency is with small, red fruit, especially in the cross-walls, close to the seeds and pith area.</p>
        <h2>Health Benefits of Capsicum</h2>

            • Improves metabolism.</br>
            • Lowers the risk of cancer.</br>
            • Antioxidant Properties.</br>
            • Improves immunity.</br>
            • Relieves pain.</br>
            • Cures iron deficiency.</br>
            
            Capsicum may help in managing blood glucose, dyslipidemia, cancers, and healing wounds. Additionally, it may help in boosting immunity, metabolism, preventing cataracts, and may provide symptomatic relief in arthritis, Crohn's disease and yellow fever.
            The vegetable is one of the best sources of carotenoids like beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein. It is also rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Here is a list of some of the health benefits of eating capsicum.

            <h2>Different type of Capsicum</h2>
            <img src="https://journals.ashs.org/horttech/view/journals/horttech/30/1/full-135fig1.jpg">
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Capsicum </h2>
            <p>Warm conditions over a five month growing period are necessary for high yields and good quality fruit. Capsicums and chillies require slightly warmer temperatures than tomatoes or cucumbers. Chillies are more tolerant of high temperatures than capsicums. Optimum temperatures for fruit set are between 16°C and 21°C. For good fruit development, night temperatures of 15–17°C and day temperatures of 24–30°C are ideal.
                Capsicums can be damaged by frost. Plants retarded by cool weather tend to harden and seldom regain the vigorous growth necessary for high yields. During cold weather, the fruit remains small, hard and malformed because of uneven pollination. The fruit may also have numerous growth cracks.
                The fruit may be sun-scorched during hot weather and fruit will show poor setting and poor colouring when temperatures are above 33°C.Soils must be well-drained, with optimum pH of 5.0–6.0 (measured in calcium chloride) and low salinity.
                </p>
<h2> Water Supply for Capsicum </h2>
<p>Irrigation at weekly or 10 days interval. Apply FYM @ 25 t / ha as basal before last ploughing. Apply 2 kg/ha of Azospirillum and 2 kg/ha of Phosphobacteria by mixing with 20 kg of FYM. Apply 75 % total recommended dose of super phosphate ie 703 kg / ha as basal.Precision irrigation brings tangible results to capsicum cultivation, and therefore a lot of farmers across the country are resorting to precision irrigation.The irrigation water for cultivation of capsicum crop was taken from bore existed at 
    College of Agricultural Engineering, Madakasira. It is tested and presented in the irrigation.

    <h2> Harvestingn of  Capsicum</h2>
    <img src="https://www.aaaksc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/harvesting.jpg">
    <p>Green capsicum can be harvested at 55 to 60 days after transplanting, yellow capsicum at 70-75 days whereas red capsicum at 80-90 days. Fruits can be harvested once in 3 to 4 days. Yellow and red fruits can be harvested when they have gained 22 50-80 per cent of the colour development.
        You can start harvesting your capsicums when they grow to the size of a tennis ball and the skin starts to look smooth and glossy.
        </p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Capsicum annuum is a species of the plant genus Capsicum native to southern North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. This species is the most common and extensively cultivated of the five domesticated capsicums.
