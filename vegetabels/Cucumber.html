<p>Irrigate the field before dibbling the seeds and thereafter once a week. Apply FYM 40 t/ha as basal and 35 kg of N/ha at 30 days after sowing. Apply Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria 2 kg/ha and Pseudomonoas 2.5 kg/ha along with FYM 50 kg and neem cake @ 100 kg before last ploughing.The best method for watering cucurbits is generally drip irrigation, which allows for deep infiltration of water over time. As much as possible, keep cucurbit leaves entirely dry, particularly after plants begin to bloom and produce fruits.</p>

    <p>Harvest cucumbers when they attain at least six to eight inches in length. Keep a watchful eye out for dark green skins and firm fruits. It is best to harvest these beauties on the earlier side to reap the rewards of their sweet flesh and tender seeds. They will grow bigger and can still be eaten when harvested later.
        Plants start yielding in about 45-50 days after sowing. Mainly 10-12 harvestings can be done. Harvesting is mainly done when the seed of cucumber are soft and the fruits are green and young. Harvesting is done with the help of sharp knife or any sharp object. It gives an average of 33-42qtl/acre of yield.
