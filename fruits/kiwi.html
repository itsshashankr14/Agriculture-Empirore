    <p>Kiwi cultivation</br>
        Kiwi can be grown in areas experiencing 700-800 chilling hours (no. of hours during which temperature remains at or below 70 C during the winter season). The plant can be grown at 800-1500 m. above m.s.l. A rainfall of about 150 cm. /year is sufficient. The rainfall should be well distributed during the growing period.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of Kiwi Fruits </h2>
        <p>1.By helping to maintain a healthy blood pressure and providing a boost of Vitamin C, the kiwifruit can reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease. Beyond this, kiwi also contains a high level of dietary fiber. Fiber can reduce risk factors for heart disease by lowering LDL or bad cholesterol. </p></br>
            
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Kiwi Fruits</h2>
            <p>Deep, rich, well-drained sandy loam soils are ideal for cultivation of kiwi. A soil pH slightly less than 6.9 results in maximum yield but higher pH upto 7.3 adversely affects the yield due to Mn deficiency. The crop can come up very well in certain locations of Himachal Pradesh and parts of Kerala.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Kiwi Fruits</h2>

    <p>The kiwi reaches its full size in August, but it is not ready to pick until its seeds turn black, which is usually in October or November. Kiwi are ready to harvest when they are firm, but starting to give a little when gently squeezed. Kiwi continues to ripen once it has been removed from the vine.</p>
