    <h2>Introdution of Pear Fruits</h2>
    <p>Pears are fruits produced and consumed around the world, growing on a tree and harvested in late summer into mid-autumn. The pear tree and shrub are a species of genus Pyrus /ˈpaɪrəs/, in the family Rosaceae, bearing the pomaceous fruit of the same name. Several species of pears are valued for their edible fruit and juices, while others are cultivated as trees.</br></br>
        The tree is medium-sized and native to coastal and mildly temperate regions of Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Pear wood is one of the preferred materials in the manufacture of high-quality woodwind instruments and furniture.</br></br>
        About 3,000 known varieties of pears are grown worldwide, which vary in both shape and taste. The fruit is consumed fresh, canned, as juice, dried, or fermented as perry.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement for Pear Fruits</h2>
            <p>Pear grows best in deep, medium textured and well drained soils. Pear can be grown from foothills to high hills (600-2700 msl) experiencing 500-1500 chilling hours. It can tolerate as low as -26°c temperature when dormant and as high as 45°C during growing period.
            </br>
            In general, the pear tree thrives in cold and wet climate, where there is winter cold along with a cool summer. It is estimated that the popular pear varieties need about 400-800 hours of cold (exposure to temperatures below 45 °F or 7 °C) in order to have a regular development and fruition.</p>

    <p>The best way to tell if a pear is ready to harvest is by taking the fruit in your hand and tilting it horizontally. The mature fruit will easily come away from the branch at this angle (as opposed to its natural vertical hanging position). If it is not yet ready for picking, it will hold on to the branch.</br></br>
