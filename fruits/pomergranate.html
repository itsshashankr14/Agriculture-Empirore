    <h2>Introdution of Pomegranate Fruits </h2>
    <p>pomegranate, (Punica granatum), bush or small tree of the family Lythraceae and its fruit. The juicy arils of the fruit are eaten fresh, and the juice is the source of grenadine syrup, used in flavourings and liqueurs. Pomegranate is high in dietary fibre, folic acid, vitamin C, and vitamin K. pomegranate</br>While the pomegranate is considered indigenous to Iran and neighbouring countries, its cultivation long ago encircled the Mediterranean and extended through the Arabian Peninsula, Afghanistan, and India. It is commonly cultivated in the Americas from the warmer parts of the United States to Chile.

        Though the pomegranate grows in a wide range of climates, good fruit is produced only where high temperatures and dry atmosphere accompany the ripening period. Deep, rather heavy loams appear to be the best soils. Seeds can readily be grown, but choice varieties are reproduced by cutting and layerings. Commercial propagation is performed by taking hardwood cuttings 250–300 mm (10–12 inches) long and rooting them in the open ground.</p>

            <h2>Different type of Pomegranate Fruits</h2>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for  Pomegranate Fruits</h2>
            <p>Pomegranate can be grown on a wide range of soils. However, it grows well in medium deep, loamy and well-drained soils having a pH of 7.5. Heavy soils with poor drainage facilities are unsuitable for its cultivation. the fruit colour development, quality and increases pest and disease attack.</br>
                Pomegranates perform best on deep loamy soils, but will still grow quite well in sandy and clay soils. Trees are tolerant of moderately acid to slightly alkaline soils and grow best in a soil pH range of 5.5 to 7.2. Though pomegranates can tolerate short periods of standing water, they prefer well-drained soils</p>
<h2> Water Supply in  Pomegranate Fruits</h2>
<img src="https://agrosiaa.com/uploads/userdata/blogs/24/16144008903.png">
<p>The depth of irrigation is directly associated with the depth of the pomegranate root system. 80% of the feeding takes place in the 50-60cm depth. Precision irrigation helps prevent leaching of fertilizers beyond the feeding root zone. Adequate fertilizer use results in an increased pomogranate yield.</br>
    Irrigation requirement is the total quantity of water applied to the land surface in supplement to the water supplied through rainfall and soil profile to meet the water needs of crops for optimum growth. </p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of  Pomegranate Fruits</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZuzZXT3A1aQ/maxresdefault.jpg">
    <p>Generally speaking, pomegranate trees will produce a reliable harvest two to three years after planting. They flower from midspring into fall, and fruits that are set in March or April will be ready for harvest between August and October, depending on the variety.</br>
        Pomegranate harvesting is similar to that of other tree fruits. The fruit is harvested using clippers and placed into bags. (Some similar harvesting processes that you can see include avocados, mandarins and peaches.) Not all pomegranates on the same tree are ready for harvest at the same time</p>
