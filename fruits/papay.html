    <h2>Introdution of  Papaya Fruits </h2>
    <p>This article is about Carica papaya, the widely cultivated papaya (also called papaw or pawpaw), a tropical fruit plant. For the mountain papaya (Vasconcellea pubescens) of South America, see Mountain papaya. For the Eastern North American tree (and fruit) called "pawpaw", see Asimina triloba. For other uses, see Papaya (disambiguation).
        Not to be confused with Chaenomeles speciosa (flowering quince) or Pseudocydonia chinensis (Chinese quince), which like Carica papaya are sometimes called mugua</br>
        The papaya is a small, sparsely branched tree, usually with a single stem growing from 5 to 10 m (16 to 33 ft) tall, with spirally arranged leaves confined to the top of the trunk. The lower trunk is conspicuously scarred where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, 50–70 cm (20–28 in) in diameter, deeply palmately lobed, with seven lobes. All plant parts contain latex in articulated laticifers.[10]</p>

        <h2>Benefits of  Papaya Fruits </h2>
        <p>The possible health benefits of consuming papaya include a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, aiding in digestion, improving blood glucose control in people with diabetes, lowering blood pressure, and improving wound healing. </p></br>
            <h2>Different type of  Papaya Fruits</h2>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for  Papaya Fruits </h2>
            <p>The plant grows well in I sandy loam soil having PH between 6.5 I to 7. Papaya grows well in sun, warm & humid climate. The plant can be grown to elevation of 1000 m above the sea level but can't withstand frost. Ideal temperature for papaya is between 25 to 30 degree centigrade.</br>
                Papaya being a tropical fruit grows well in the mild sub-tropical regions of the country upto 1,000 m. above sea level. Night temperature below 120-140 C for several hours during winter season affects its growth and production severely. It is very much sensitive to frost, strong winds and water stagnation.</p>
<h2> Water Supply in  Papaya Fruits</h2>

<p> Ring and drip irrigation are the preferred methods of irrigation. Drip irrigation with 80% replenishment of evaporation losses is recommended. During summer months, the plants should be given 20-25 L of water and can be gradually reduced to 10-15 L of water/plant in winter. Drip irrigation helps to save 50-60% water.</br>
    The economic life of papaya plant is only 3 to 4 years. The yield varies widely according to variety, soil, climate and management of the orchard. The yield of 75-100 tonnes /ha. is obtained in a season from a papaya orchard depending on spacing and cultural practices.

    <h2> Harvestingn of Papaya Fruits</h2>

    <p>When papaya plants are short, fruits can be harvested by hand while one is standing on the ground. As the plants grow taller, harvesting aids are required. One technique uses a modified plumber's helper to snap the papaya from the stem. The fruit is caught before it falls to the ground.</br>
        Well-cared-for plants may begin to produce flowers 4 months after planting and fruit 7 to 11 months after plant- ing. The amount of fruit produced by a papaya plant varies with the general climate, weather conditions during the year, and plant care.</p>
