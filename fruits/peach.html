    <h2>Introdution of Peach Fruits</h2>
    <p>The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree first domesticated and cultivated in Zhejiang province of Eastern China.[3] It bears edible juicy fruits with various characteristics, most called peaches and others (the glossy-skinned, non-fuzzy varieties), nectarines.</br></br>
        The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus, which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum, in the rose family. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell (endocarp).[4] Due to their close relatedness, the kernel of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement for Peach Fruits</h2>
            <p>Peaches prefer slightly acid soil (pH 6.0-6.8) and thrive in lightweight loamy, well-draining soil. It is vital to not plant peach trees in low spots in the landscape where water pools, as this can contribute to problems like root rot, which can cause the demise of your tree.</br>
                Peach trees grow best in climates with hot summers and winter temperatures colder than 45Â°F. Most peach varieties require time in cold temperatures in order to grow effectivel</p>
<h2> Water Supply in  Peach Fruits</h2>

    Peaches are hand harvested into bags. They harvest the fruit while it is still firm, as peaches are climacteric and will continue ripening after harvest. Once the bags are full, they dump them into big bins that are lined up on a tractor in the field</br>
    Drip irrigation is a type of micro-irrigation system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of the plants, either above the soil surface or buried below the surface. Drip is the most efficient way to irrigate</p>

        April to May is the peak month of harvesting peach crop. They reach good color and hard flesh that shows they are ready to harvest. Harvesting of peach crop is carried by twisting the fruit.</p>
