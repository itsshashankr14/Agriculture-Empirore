    <h2>Introdution of Cherry Fruits</h2>
    <p>Cherry plants are propagated mainly through grafting method. Seedling Rootstock in Cherry Fruit Cultivation:- In India, seedling of bird cherry, paja, mazzard & mahaleb are used to raise the sweet cherry plants.</br>
        In the North, cherries appear in shops of all sizes during the late fall and early winter months, and again during mid-May. When in season, a few varieties trickle down south, and most vendors of mid to large-sized produce shops sell them</br>
        All cherries prefer deep, fertile, well-drained soil that is ideally slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.5–6.7. They grow less well in shallow or sandy soil, and poorly drained conditions can cause the roots to rot.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Cherry Fruits </h2>
            <p>The cherry tree requires the deep sandy loam soil with the pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. A well drained fertile soil with moisture holding capacity is best for cherry cultivation. As the cherry trees are sensitive to water stagnation, make sure to have internal well drainage in the soil</br>
                Most cherries require around 500-700 hours of winter chill. The optimum temperature is around 6 °C (42.8 °F), while temperatures above 14 °C (57.2 °F) during the chilling period can negate previously accumulated chill.

<h2> Water Supply in Cherry Fruits </h2>

<p>Drip irrigation is most suitable for row crops (vegetables, soft fruit), tree and vine crops where one or more emitters can be provided for each plant. Generally only high value crops are considered because of the high capital costs of installing a drip system
</br>
Surface irrigation can be used for all types of crops. Sprinkler and drip irrigation, because of their high capital investment per hectare, are mostly used for high value cash crops, such as vegetables and fruit trees. </p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of  Cherry Fruits</h2>
    <img src="https://archive.sltrib.com/images/2013/0731/harvest_080113~2.jpg">
    <p>Among commercially-grown fruits, it's common knowledge that cherries are the last trees to bloom and the first to harvest. So for most cherry crops in the area, harvest season starts from mid-April to late July. That's not very long for such a popular fruit!</br>
        Once your cherry blossoms have given way to fruit buds, you can typically expect to harvest ripe cherries anywhere from early June through to late July. Sweet cherry varieties, which are great for eating fresh, ripen a little earlier than sour cherries, which are more commonly used for cherry pie and preserves.</p>
