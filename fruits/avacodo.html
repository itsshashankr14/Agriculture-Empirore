    <h2>Introdution of Avocado Fruits</h2>
    <p>Also known as an alligator pear or butter fruit, avocados are actually a type of berry. They grow in warm climates. Avocados provide a substantial amount of monounsaturated fatty acids and are rich in many vitamins and minerals. Incorporating them into a varied, healthy diet can provide a number of benefits.</br>The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated by Mesoamerican tribes more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit.[3] The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.[4][5][6] Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.[7] Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output.[8] Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries.[4] Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.</br>

        The fruit of domestic varieties have smooth, buttery, golden-green flesh when ripe. Depending on the cultivar, avocados have green, brown, purplish, or black skin, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. For commercial purposes the fruits are picked while unripe and ripened after harvesting. The nutrient density and extremely high fat content of avocado flesh are useful to a variety of cuisines and are often eaten to enrich vegetarian diets.</br>
        
        In major production regions like Chile, Mexico and California the water demands of avocado farms place strain on local sources.[11] Avocado production is also implicated in other externalities, including deforestation and human rights concerns associated with the partial control of their production in Mexico by organized crime.[12][13][14][15] Global warming is expected to result in significant changes to the suitable growing zones for avocados, and place additional pressures on the locales in which they are produced due to heat waves and drought.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Avocado Fruits</h2>
            <p>Avocado trees can grow well in a wide range of soils. The ideal soil for most varieties is loose, loamy, or sandy with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, between 5 and 7 (1). However, farmers should generally avoid establishing an avocado orchard in fields with poor drainage and high salinity.</br>
                Avocados like loose, rich, well-draining soil. Plant in a container that has drainage holes, in good quality potting soil. The soil may need to be sandy to accommodate the tree's large roots and fast draining so that the roots do not succumb to root rot fungus.

<h2> Water Supply in  Avocado Fruits</h2>

<p> In Mediterranean climates, a single tree may require up to 51 mm (2 in) of water per week during the dry and warm summer months. More specifically, based on scientific data, in hot climates, avocado water use is around 45 liters per day (l/day) in spring, 136 to 220 l/day during summer, and 121 l/day in autumn (2, 3).</br>Newly planted trees may need water two to three times per week their first year. Mature avocado trees need water equal to about 2 inches of rainfall or irrigation each week during summer. Fertilizing - Avocados do best with plant foods designed specifically for avocados and citrus.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Avocado Fruits</h2>

    <p>Taking up to eight months between bloom and harvest, you will see edible fruits between June and October, depending on the growing conditions and local environment.</br>
        The Hass variety can be 'snap' picked (plucked from the tree) but should be 'snip' picked (cut from the tree with a pair of special secateurs) if there has been recent wet weather or if it's the start of the harvest season. Varieties other than Hass should also be 'snip' picked.</p>
