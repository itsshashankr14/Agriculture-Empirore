    <h2>Introdution of Watermelon</h2>
    <p>Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.</br>

        Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for  Watermelon</h2>
            <p>Soil:
                Watermelons can be grown on well-drained sandy to sandy loam, medium black soils rich in organic
                matter. Alluvial soil along the river beds is also good for production of watermelons. A pH range of 6.0-
                7.0 is considered as optimum.</br>
                Climate:
                Watermelon is a warm season crop grown mainly in sub-tropical and hot-arid regions. The crop
                requires dry weather with abundant sunshine for quality fruit production. Watermelons are susceptible
                to light frost and are provided with partial protection if grown during winter months. Temperature range
                0 of 24-27 C is considered as optimum for the growth of the vines. Cool nights and warm days are ideal
                for accumulation of sugars in the fruits. The seed germinates best when temperatures are higher than
                0 20 C. High humidity at the time of vegetative growth renders the crop susceptible to various fungal
                diseases</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Watermelons </h2>

<p>Watermelon is normally seeded directly in the fields. Thinning is practised 15 to 25 days after sowing. Spacing between plants and rows varies from 0.6 x 0.9 to 1.8 x 2.4 m. Seeds are sometimes placed on hills spaced 1.8 x 2.4m. </p>

    <p>Fruits are harvested when it produces dull sound upon tapping or the fruits surface on the ground level produces light yellow colour are the harvest index for water melon. 25 â€“ 30 t/ha of fruits in 120 days can be obtained.</p>
