    <p>Pineapple cultivation</br>
        Pineapple grows well in any type of soil having a good retention of moisture, drainage and aeration. Cultivation over hardpan in sub soil and water logging should be avoided. The optimum temperature range for successful cultivation is between 15.60 C and 32.20 C.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for  Pineapple</h2>
            <p>Pineapple grows in warm and humid climate. It is mostly grown at low elevations in areas with a temperature range of 15 to 30ºC. It is tolerant to drought because of the special water storage cells. However, high temperature over 35ºC is unfavourable for the development of fruits.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Pineapple</h2>

<p> Evenly distributed rainfall (or irrigation) of 600-1000 mm per year is considered adequate for maximum growth. It is important to note that pineapples need between 80 and 100 millimeters (mm) of rain each month in general. Irrigation is required when the annual precipitation falls below 500 mm</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of  Pineapple</h2>

    <p>To harvest the pineapple, simply cut it from the plant with a sharp kitchen knife where the pineapple joins the stalk. Then either leave it to further ripen at room temp if need be, refrigerate the fruit if completely ripe, or, ideally, devour immediately</p>
