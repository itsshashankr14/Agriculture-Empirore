    <p>Mangoes are generally harvested at physiologically mature stage and ripened for optimum quality. Fruits are hand picked or plucked with a harvester. During harvesting, the latex trickles down the fruit surface from the point of detachment imparting a shabby appearance to it upon storage.
    </br>
    To harvest your mangos, give the fruit a tug. If the stem snaps off easily, it's ripe. Continue to harvest in this manner or use pruning shears to remove the fruit. Try to leave a 4 inch (10 cm.)
