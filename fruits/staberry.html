    <h2>Introdution of  </h2>
    <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.</br>

        The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.</br>
        
        The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.</p>

            <h2>Different type of Strawberry Fruits</h2>
            <img src="https://i1.wp.com/agnetwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/strawberry-varieties.jpg">
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Strawberry Fruits </h2>
            <p>Strawberry requires a well-drained medium loam soil, rich in organic matter. The soil should be slightly acidic with pH from 5.7 to 6.5. At higher pH root formation is poor. The presence of excessive calcium in the soil causes yellowing of the leaves.</br>
                sandy loam soil
                Strawberries grow best in a deep, sandy loam soil rich in organic matter. The soil must be well-drained. Keep away from areas that remain wet late into the spring. The site should receive full sunlight and have a gradual slope.</p>
<h2> Water Supply in  Strawberry Fruits</h2>

<p> The two main types of irrigation for strawberries are drip irrigation and overhead sprinklers. June-bearing strawberries can use either system, but day-neutral strawberries require drip irrigation. When exploring irrigation systems and vendors, select a system that can monitor water delivery and soil moisture.</br>
    Strawberries have shallow roots. To get maximum growth and yield, never let plants be stressed by lack of water. Keep newly set strawberries well irrigated. The plants will need about 2.5 to 3.5 Cm of water a week; supplement rain with irrigation as needed.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Strawberry Fruits </h2>

    <p>Strawberry (Fragaria vesca) is an important fruit crop of India and its commercial production is possible in temperate and sub-tropical areas of the country. but varieties are available which can be cultivated in the subtropical climate. In India, it is generally cultivated in the hills.</br>
        Strawberries are harvested in small trays or baskets. They should be kept in a shady place to avoid damage due to excessive heat in the open field. Plants start bearing in second year. An average yield of 45-100 q./ha. is obtained from a strawberry orchard.</br>
        For most of the country, June is prime time for strawberries. You might also see them in the fall at some farmers' markets, thanks to ever-bearing varieties that can produce until nearly the first frost. If you do, consider yourself lucky. "They're so delicate</p>
