    <h2>Introdution of Grapes </h2>
    <p>Grape is usually propagated by hard wood cuttings, though propagation by seed, soft wood cuttings, layering, grafting and budding is also used in some cases. The grapevines are usually planted in pits. The size of the pit depends upon the spacing of the vines and also on the specific requirements of the variety </br>
        The fruit contains about 20% sugar in easily digestible form besides being rich in calcium and phosphorus.  World over it is grown mainly for wine making (82% production), raisin making (10% production) and rest for table purpose (8%). In India, however it is mostly consumed as fresh fruit and only a limited quantity is utilized for the production of liquor, dry fruits like raisins etc.

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Grapes </h2>
            <p>The soil should be well drained, having good water holding capacity and devoid of any hard pan or impervious layer in the top 90-cm, with water table at least 6.5m below. Grapes can also be grown successfully over a wide range of soil pH (4.0-9.5) however, soils having pH range of 6.5-8.0 are considered ideal.</p>
<h2> Water Supply for Grapes </h2>

<p> Vines are irrigated immediately after pruning and fertilizer application. During the berry growth stage, irrigation is given at intervals of 5-7 days. Water is withheld for at least 8-10 days prior to harvesting to improve the fruit quality. Irrigation is resumed after pruning.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Grapes </h2>

    <p>In most cases, grapes are hand-harvested. Hand-harvesting is performed using knives and/or shears, either manual or electric. After whole bunches are cut, workers place them in collection baskets and transfer them to the winery (wine varieties) or to special warehouses (table grapes varieties).</p>
