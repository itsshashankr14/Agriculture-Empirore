    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>Tulip bulbs are planted in the autumn before the ground freezes. By planting varieties with different bloom
        times, you can have tulips blooming from early to late spring. Some types are good for forcing into bloom
        indoors and most are excellent for use as cut flowers, too.

        Tulip flowers are usually cup-shaped with three petals and three sepals. There’s a tulip for every setting, from
        small “species” tulips in naturalised woodland areas to larger tulips that fit formal garden plantings from beds
        to borders. The upright flowers may be single or double, and vary in shape from simple cups, bowls, and goblets
        to more complex forms. Height ranges from 6 inches to 2 feet. One tulip grows on each stem, with two to six
        broad leaves per plant.</p>
    <img src="https://imgcdn.floweraura.com/tulip-garden-cover-image.jpg">
    <p>Tulips prefer a site with full or afternoon sun. In Zones 7 and 8, choose a shady site or one with morning sun
        only, as tulips don’t like a lot of heat.

        Soil must be well-draining, neutral to slightly acidic, fertile, and dry or sandy. All tulips dislike areas with
        excessive moisture. Prepare the garden bed by using a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to a depth of 12
        to 15 inches, then mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost.

        Tall varieties should be sheltered from strong winds.Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard,
        ground-freezing frost is expected. The bulbs need time to establish themselves. Planting too early leads to
        disease problems. See local frost dates.
        A good rule of thumb is to plant bulbs when the average nighttime temperatures in your area are in the 40- to
        50-degree range.
        In colder northern climates, plant in September or October. In warmer climates, plant bulbs in December (or even
        later).
        To find the best dates, consult our fall bulb planting chart.
        Nature never intended for bulbs to loll about above ground, so don’t delay planting the bulbs after purchase.
        In southern climates with mild winters, plant bulbs in late November or December. The bulbs will need to be
        chilled in the refrigerator for about 12 weeks before planting. (Bulb suppliers often offer pre-chilled bulbs
        for sale, too.)
        If you miss planting your bulbs at the optimal time, don’t wait for spring or next fall. Bulbs aren’t like
        seeds. Even if you find an unplanted sack of tulips or daffodils in January or February, plant them and take
        your chances. See more about planting tulips in winter.</p>
    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://www.agrifarming.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tulip-Cultivation.jpg">
    <p>Plant bulbs fairly deep—6 to 8 inches deep, or about three times the height of the bulb. Dig a hole deeper than
        that in order to loosen the soil and allow for drainage. In clay soils, plant 3 to 6 inches deep instead.
        Space bulbs 4 to 6 inches apart.
        Set the bulb in the hole with the pointy end up. Cover with soil and press soil firmly.
        Water bulbs right after planting. Although they can’t bear wet feet, bulbs need water to trigger growth.
        If you’re planning to raise perennial tulips, feed them a balanced fertilizer when you plant them in the fall.
        Bulbs are their own complete storage system and contain all of the nutrients they need for one year. Use organic
        material, compost, or a balanced time-release bulb food.
        To deter mice and moles—if they have been a problem—put holly or any other thorny leaves in the planting holes.
        Some gardeners use kitty litter or crushed gravel. If ravenous voles and rodents are a real problem, you may
        need to take stronger measures, such as planting bulbs in buried wire cages.
        Don’t lose hope if you’re planting your tulips later in the season—just follow these tips.</p>
    <h2>Water Supply</h2>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/sagacity/image/upload/c_crop,h_664,w_1000,x_0,y_0/c_scale,w_1080/v1396722797/0414-woodenshoe-tulip-farm_atep7d.jpg">
    <p>If it rains weekly, do not water. However, if there is a dry spell and it does not rain, you should water the
        bulbs weekly until the ground freezes.
        Rainy summers, irrigation systems, and wet soil are death to tulips. Never deliberately water a bulb bed unless
        in a drought. Wet soil leads to fungus and disease and can rot bulbs. Add shredded pine bark, sand, or any other
        rough material to the soil to foster swift drainage.
        Apply compost annually to provide nutrients needed for future blooms.
        In the spring, when leaves emerge, feed your tulip the same bulb food or bone meal which you used at planting
        time. Water well.
        Deadhead tulips as soon as they go by, but do not remove the leaves!
        Allow the leaves to remain on the plants for about 6 weeks after flowering. The tulips need their foliage to
        gather energy for next year’s blooms! After the foliage turns yellow and dies back, it can be pruned off.
        Large varieties may need replanting every few years; small types usually multiply and spread on their
        own.Irrigation. In a complete growing season, i.e., from plantation of tulip bulbs to harvesting of bulbs, 2 to
        8 irrigation is required depending on local climatic condition & soil type. Give first irrigation immediately
        after plantation of tulip bulbs. Throughout winter you can avoid irrigating tulip farm.Water tulips when you
        plant them, giving each planting area a thorough soak. Water once per week week for the first month after
        planting, then leave the plants alone until springtime. Begin watering again in the springtime, when the leaves
        appear.</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <img src="https://crosscut.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/2p1a0706_0.jpg">
    <p>Tulips should be harvested in the early spring, just as they begin to grow. If you want to decorate a table or
        vase with tulips, simply cut the flower from the stems. Bulbs can also be harvested if you want to transplant or
        give them away.

    <p>
        The yield of tulip flowers and bulbs in one acre will be roughly between 2.5 lakh and five lakh.The four steps
        of harvesting are reaping, threshing, cleaning, and transporting. Utilising cutting-edge technology to harvest
        crops is crucial since it decreases grain waste and improves grain quality and quantity.</p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Holland is a small country situated between the North Sea, Germany and Belgium. When you think of Holland, there
        are several things that come to mind; art, cheese, windmills, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, endless beautiful landscapes
        and of course blooming tulips.</p>
