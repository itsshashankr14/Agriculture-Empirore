    <p>Climate: It requires a temperature of 30 - 35°C for growth. It is shade tolerant to some extent but susceptible to low temperature and frost. Soil: Well drained sandy loam and red soils with pH of 6 - 7.5 are ideal. Soil is to be tested for nematodes before planting.
        India, winter is the best time to grow many different species of beautiful blooming annuals. The seeds of winter flowering annuals are sown in October-November. Some seedlings almost hibernate during the cold months of December & January & start growing as soon

    <h2>Water Supply</h2>

    <p>Crossandra is very susceptible to drought and likes slightly moist soil—but not soggy—at all times. Outdoors, water this plant moderately on alternating days during the growing season. Never allow the soil to completely dry out. Reduce the amount of water in the winter to once a week, if you're growing it as a perennial.
        Outdoor, you can use the same watering guide—decreasing the water in the winter to once a week—but always water your crossandra with warm water. This tropical plant dislikes the cold, and watering it with cold water may shock the roots, causing the plant to die.
