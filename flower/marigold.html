    <p>The requirements for cultivation of Marigold are well-drained soil and a sunny spot. Marigold Season: In India,
        Seeds can be sown any time of the year; but the best time to start Marigolds by seeds is between May-July. The
        seeds are sown throughout the year. Nursery is raised with 1.5 kg seeds/ha and the seedlings are transplanted
        after four weeks on one side of the ridge at 45 x 35 cm spacing. Treat the seeds with Azospirillum (200 g in 50
        ml of rice gruel) before sowing. Irrigation is done once in a week or as and when necessary.

    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2022/11/6366da8d4e2c0.jpg">
    <p>Marigolds require mild climate of luxuriant growth and profuse flowering. For seeds germination optimum
        temperature ranges 180 C to 300 C. Planting is carried out during rainy season winter and summer season hence
        flowers of marigold can be had almost throughout the year.
        Marigolds prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. You can amend the soil with compost or other
        organic matter to improve its quality.
        French (Dwarf) marigolds are best cultivated in light soil whereas a rich well drained, moist soils are best
        suited for African (Tall) marigolds. However, sandy loam soil having pH 7.0-7.5 with good aeration and drainage
        are considered ideal for the cultivation of marigold

    <img src="https://gardenerspath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tips-for-Watering-Marigolds.jpg">
    <p>Marigolds need moist soil for the first week or two after planting to establish a strong root system. Once
        established, they require watering around once per week and more often in summer when temperatures are high.
        Avoid overhead watering to stop the dense blooms from rotting and to prevent fungal growth on the leaves.
        Marigolds prefer moist soil, so water them regularly. However, be careful not to overwater them, as this can
        lead to root rot.
        Marigolds are relatively pest and disease resistant, but they can still be affected by common garden pests such
        as aphids and spider mites. Monitor your plants regularly and treat any problems that arise promptly.
