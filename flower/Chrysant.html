    <h3>Chrysanthemums (ಸೇವಂತಿಗೆ)</h3>

    <h2>Information</h2>
    <img src="https://indiagardening.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2Shevanti.jpg">
    <p>To grow the Shevanti plant from the flower (seeds), you need to collect seeds from the flower after its flowering
        season has passed. For this don't pluck the green-colored pods first let them ripe. Once they are ripe, prune
        them and break the pods open on paper to collect the seeds and let them dry for 1 – 2 days.
        Chrysanthemums are sunlight loving perennials that love full sun conditions. If they get less than 6 hours, or
        spend time in the dappled shade, their blooms will not be as robust as they can be with additional time in the
        sun.
        Spacing: 15x 15 cm (45 plants/m2) or 10 x 15 cm (67 plants/m2).
        If your plant is well fed and gets plenty of water, it will have the fuel to produce all those bright flowers.
        Feed plants in early spring and every 2 weeks until buds have formed. You can also enhance blooming by removing
        spent flowers, a practice called deadheading.
    </p>

    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v4lOG_tORj8/maxresdefault.jpg">
    <p>Chrysanthemums enjoy a warm, sunny, sheltered spot, with fertile, well-drained soil. Water and feed regularly,
        and protect them from frost.
        The primary growth of chrysanthemum plant varieties takes place in spring and early summer. Growing
        chrysanthemums are heavy feeders.
        The rainy season is also the perfect time for flower enthusiasts to prepare for one of the most spectacular
        winter flowers — chrysanthemum. It is a herbaceous perennial, which survives winter chill spectacularly during
        late November and early December.
        annual Chrysanthemum, Seed sowing is done during 'June-July' for rainy season flowering & seeds are sown in
        'September' for winter flowering.

    <h2>Water Supply</h2>

    <p>
        Drip irrigation applies water directly to the ground or soil very slowly, which results in very little water
        loss due to evaporation or runoff. The soil soaks up water, which is then directly taken into the root system of
        the plant.
        Shevanti plants require frequent watering due to their sunlight requirement. These plants tend to lose moisture
        when you keep them in the sun for too long; thus, it becomes necessary to water it often. Long sun exposure can
        even dry up your plants, so it is a good idea to create a layer of mulch to prevent water loss.
        Don't let your mums get too dry or wilt between waterings. Water your potted mums at least every other day. They
        like to get about 1 inch of water per week. Water at the soil level (the base of the plant) and not on top of
        the foliage.
        Shevanti plant care demands providing it full sunlight, and also making sure that it is kept away from night
        light source during its blooming season. Watering needs to be balanced as too little or too much water will
        start causing troubles. Then, you have come to the right place.

    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/farmers-walk-bright-yellow-chrysanthemum-fields-harvesting-chrysanthemum-flowers-drying-making-chrysanthemum-233833594.jpg">
    <p>The flowers are harvested 3 months from the date of planting at an interval of 4 days. For floral decoration and
        garlands, fully opened flowers are plucked with or without the peduncle.
        Just as you notice buds appearing in your mum plants is the best time to harvest them. Harvest cut flower
        chrysanthemums just as the buds are starting to open for maximum vase life. Cut deep into the plant just above a
        set of leaves. Strip off the lower leaves of the stem and place them in fresh, cool water.
        Generally harvesting is done early in the morning. The stems are cut 20 cm from the ground and are
        collected in trays or buckets containing cold water (15-18°C) and a floral preservative (Silver nitrate 25
        ppm). Alternately, the harvested stems are kept in 1000 ppm Silver nitrate, for 10 seconds-10 minutes
        followed by placing in deionized water to prevent the blockage of xylem by the microorganisms

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Chrysanthemum flowers, also known as "mums," are popular ornamental plants in India and are grown in many states
        across the country. However, the state of Tamil Nadu is particularly famous for its chrysanthemum production.
        The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is known as the "Chrysanthemum City" and holds an annual flower show
        featuring chrysanthemums. Other states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Kerala also have
        significant chrysanthemum cultivation.
