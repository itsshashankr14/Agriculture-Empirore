    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>Appearance: Globe amaranth flowers feature round-shaped flower heads composed of tightly packed bracts. The
        bracts are papery and come in various colors, including shades of purple, pink, red, white, and orange. The
        flowers are small and inconspicuous, nestled within the bracts.

        Growth and Size: Globe amaranth is a compact, bushy annual plant that typically grows up to 1 to 2 feet (30-60
        cm) in height. It has a dense growth habit, and its flowers are borne on sturdy, upright stems.

        Blooming Season: Globe amaranth flowers generally bloom throughout the summer and fall, providing a colorful
        display in gardens or containers. They have a long flowering period, with individual blooms lasting for several
        weeks.
    </p>
    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>Temperature: Globe amaranth prefers warm temperatures and is sensitive to frost. It thrives in regions with
        average temperatures ranging between 70째F to 85째F (21째C to 29째C).
        Sunlight: These flowers require full sun to flourish, so they do best in areas with at least 6 hours of direct
        sunlight per day.
        Soil:
        Soil Type: Globe amaranth can adapt to different soil types, including sandy, loamy, or clay soils. However,
        well-drained soil is crucial to prevent waterlogging, as excessive moisture can lead to root rot.
        pH Level: The ideal soil pH range for Globe amaranth is slightly acidic to neutral, between 6.0 and 7.0. If
        necessary, you can adjust the soil pH by adding organic matter or appropriate soil amendments.
        Fertility: While Globe amaranth can tolerate average soil fertility, it performs best in moderately fertile
        soils. Adding compost or well-rotted organic matter before planting can help improve soil fertility.

    </p>
    <h2>Water Supply</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>Watering Frequency: Water Globe amaranth deeply but infrequently. Allow the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out
        between watering sessions to avoid overwatering. Aim for a regular watering schedule, particularly during dry
        periods, to ensure the plant receives adequate moisture.

        Soil Moisture: Globe amaranth prefers well-drained soil, so it's essential to avoid waterlogged conditions.
        Overly wet soil can lead to root rot and other plant health issues. Check the soil moisture level before
        watering by sticking your finger about an inch into the soil. If it feels dry at that depth, it's time to water.

        Watering Method: Water the base of the plant directly at the soil level rather than wetting the foliage. This
        helps prevent fungal diseases and conserves water by minimizing evaporation.

        Mulching: Applying a layer of organic mulch around the base of the plant can help retain soil moisture, reduce
        weed growth, and regulate soil temperature. Mulching also helps prevent rapid evaporation, thereby reducing the
        frequency of watering required.

        Drought Periods: During extended dry periods or heatwaves, it may be necessary to increase the frequency and
        amount of watering to ensure the plants don't become excessively stressed. Monitor the soil moisture closely
        during these times and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.

        Rainfall: Consider the amount of rainfall your area receives when determining the watering needs of Globe
        amaranth. If there is consistent rainfall, you may need to reduce the frequency of manual watering, whereas
        during drier periods, additional irrigation may be required

    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <img src="https://www.allaboutgardening.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Person-Harvesting-Pink-Flowers.jpg">
    <p>Timing: Harvest Globe amaranth flowers when they are fully open and at their peak color. This usually occurs when
        the bracts are vibrant and firm, and the tiny inconspicuous flowers within them are visible.

        Stem Length: Cut the stems of Globe amaranth flowers to the desired length, depending on your intended use. For
        fresh floral arrangements, longer stems are typically preferred, while shorter stems work well for dried flower
        crafts.

        Cutting Technique: Use sharp pruning shears or scissors to make clean cuts just above a leaf node or set of
        leaves. This encourages new growth and maintains the plant's shape and appearance.

        Continuous Harvesting: Globe amaranth produces flowers throughout its blooming season, so you can harvest the
        flowers in multiple rounds. Regularly check the plants for new blooms and harvest them as they mature, promoting
        continuous flowering.

        Preservation: If you wish to dry Globe amaranth flowers for long-lasting use, gather several stems together and
        tie them in small bundles. Hang the bundles upside down in a cool, well-ventilated area away from direct
        sunlight. As the flowers dry, they will retain their color and shape.

        Storage: Once the flowers are fully dried, remove them from the drying location and store them in airtight
        containers or sealed bags. Keep them in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect their
        quality.

        Seed Saving: If you want to collect seeds for future planting, allow some of the flowers to remain on the plant
        until they mature and start to dry. The bracts will turn brown and papery, and the seeds will be small and dark.
        Gently collect the seeds and store them in a cool, dry place for next season's sowing
