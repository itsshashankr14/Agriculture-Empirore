    <p>hibiscus plants grow best in full sun. Tropical hibiscus needs moist but well-drained soil. Perennial hibiscus
        grows best in moist soil that never completely dries out (this type can handle a bit more water than tropical
        hibiscus). If you have a low spot in the garden, perennial hibiscus is an excellent bet for mid- to late-season
        color. Hibiscus can be purchased as young plants from nurseries and best planted in the spring. Or, they can be
        rooted from a cutting in the spring. If you wish to grow hibiscus from seed, sow outdoor 3 months before the
        last spring frost date.
        The older garden varieties could live up to 50 years and grow to heights of 0-15 feet or more, while some of the
        newer hybrids have lifespans of 5-0 years and only grow a few inches a year.
        flowers in August Season in India. You can see hibiscus flowers blooming throughout the year, however, it is the
        month of August that works favourably for their growth

    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>Soil requirement for Hibiscus Farming: Both the tropical and hardy Hibiscus plants should be planted in a
        well-drained soil amended with organic matter. Hibiscus required acidic soil. Mixing sphagnum peat moss into
        your garden soil or potting mix is one of the best ways to increase soil acidity.
        hibiscus plants grow best in full sun. Tropical hibiscus needs moist but well-drained soil. Perennial hibiscus
        grows best in moist soil that never completely dries out (this type can handle a bit more water than tropical
        hibiscus).

    <h2>Water Supply</h2>
    <img src="https://plantophiles.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3.jpg">
    <p>Keep the soil surrounding the hibiscus moist but not soggy. For the first week after planting, water daily,
        tapering off to once every two days in the second week, and then about twice a week thereafter, when there is no
        rainfall. If the weather becomes especially hot and dry, water every other day. hibiscus planted in the ground
        is to set up a (drip watering system) that drips water into the pot or ground slowly enough that the root zone
        becomes wet through and through.</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>The flowers should be plucked before 10 AM. From the first flowering of the plant and harvesting, prune the plant
        to one foot every year before the monsoon. The plant will bring out flowers three months after every pruning.
        With Hibiscus, one can collect flowers for 9 months continuously.

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Commonly Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra are hibiscus growing areas. States and areas that have
        natural remedy centers and medicinal plant processing areas have high scope in cultivating Hibiscus. PRUNING AND
        TRAINING: Pruning and training are mandatory for hibiscus plants.</p>
