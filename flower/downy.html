        Fast-growing and hardy, the downy jasmine plant requires no special care.
        Irrigation. Adequate moisture in the soil is necessary for proper growth and flowering in jasmines. Plants are
        irrigated by flooding once a week in the summer months. After flowering, no irrigation is normally required till
        after the next pruning and manuring.
        Watering – Jasmine flowers that are in-ground should be watered once a week. If it is unusually dry or hot,
        increase the frequency, but let the soil dry out in between. If your jasmine is in a container, it will likely
        require water multiple times each week, especially in the hotter months.
