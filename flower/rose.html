    <p>Roses yield 25-30 flowers per plant. In an acre, for an average of 5,000 plants yield about 1,50,000 Roses.Rose Plantation Cultivation Cost: Land preparation and layout: Rs. 30,000 to 50,000.
        Rose is a perennial woody flowering plant and there are over 30,000 rose cultivars in the market. Cultivars can be various sizes and shape with flower colour mainly ranging from red, yellow to white. Depending on cultivars they can be miniature roses to climbers that can grow up to 7 metres tall.

    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>Cultivating rose crop at higher elevation, i.e. 1500 metres and above is beneficial. However you can also cultivate rose in plains where the climate is relatively cool. Temperature and light have a great impact on growth and development of rose crop.

        The ideal temperature range for roses is between 15 to 25o Celsius. If the daylength is less than 12 hours then it can slow down the growth of rose crop. Hence daylength of 12 hours or above is suitable for cultivation of roses. But less than that can slow down the growth.
        </p>
    <h2>Water Supply</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>To properly water your roses, give them a full watering can of water once or twice a week. Try to water your plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry off during the day. If the leaves are wet at night, they might develop mildew.(drip irrigation)

    </p>
     <h2>Harvesting</h2>
     <img src="">
     <p>Harvesting is done with sharp secateure at the tight bud stage when the colour is fully developed and the petals have not yet started unfolding. There should be 1-2 mature leaves (those with five leaflets) left on the plant after the flower has been cut.
