    <h2>Introdution</h2>
    <p>Periwinkle prefers shade but will grow well in full sun. The foliage color is richer green in partial shade, but
        more flowers are produced in the sun. Rooted cuttings or established plants are normally spaced from 12 to 18
        inches apart. At a 6-inch spacing periwinkle will completely cover an area in one year.
        Periwinkle (Vinca minor) is an excellent evergreen groundcover with dark green foliage. Oblong to ovate leaves
        are opposite, simple, ½ to 2 inches long, glossy, with a short petiole. They exude a m depending on the
        cultivar. Plants bloom in March or April anilky juice when broken. Flowers are purple, blue or whited sometimes
        again in the fall. Vinca minor grows about 6 inches tll, spreading in all directioans by sending out long
        trailing and rooting shoots, which make new plants.
    </p>

    <p>Vinca major or large periwinkle is a larger, more aggressive species than V. minor. Leaves are up to 3 inches
        long. The blue, funnel-shaped flowers are 1 to 2 inches in diameter. They are borne in abundance in early spring
        and sporadically throughout the summer. Large periwinkle spreads rapidly and will mound up to 2 feet.
        Non-flowering stems root at the tips where they touch the ground.

    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <p>It is suited to all types of soil and tropical climatic conditions. Well distributed annual rainfall of 100 cm or more is ideal for cultivation. It is also suitable for raising as a rainfed crop.
       Full sun and well-drained soil are preferred. Because of its hardy nature they can be grown in almost all type of soil, they can grow even in infertile soil.Doesn't use too fertile as it will affect the flowering of plant. The pH ranges from 6 to 6.5 which is acidic is suitable for plant growth.
        Periwinkle prefers moist,o well-drained soil, abundantly supplied with organic matter, but it is tolerant of a wide variety of soil conditions. Fertilize only when necessary, preferably in the spring with a complete fertilizer such as 10-10-10 at a rate of 6 to 8 pounds per 1,000 square feet.

    <h2> Water Supply </h2>
    <img src="https://www.prakati.in/wp-content/uploads/Drip-Irrigation-System-1.jpg">
    <p>There are many types of irrigation systems, in which water is supplied to the entire field uniformly. Irrigation water can come from groundwater, through springs or wells, surface water, through rivers, lakes, or reservoirs, or even other sources, such as treated wastewater or desalinated water.
        The modern methods of irrigation include sprinkler systems, drip systems, etc. In the sprinkler system, water is sprinkled on the crop by using a pipe and nozzle system. It resembles raining. In the drip system, waterfalls drop by drop just at the position of the root.
        Places that have sparse or seasonal rainfall could not sustain agriculture without irrigation. In areas that have irregular precipitation, irrigation improves crop growth and quality. By allowing farmers to grow crops on a consistent schedule, irrigation also creates more reliable food supplies.</p>
    <h2> Harvesting </h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kauR57VvZQ0/maxresdefault.jpg">
    <p> The four steps of harvesting are reaping, threshing, cleaning, and transporting. 
        Utilizing cutting-edge technology to harvest crops is curcial since it decreases grain waste and improves grain quality and quantity.
        The crop requires 2 weedings, the first at 90 days after sowing/transplanting and second 60 days after the first weeding. The crop becomes ready for harvest of roots after one year. Two leaf strippings can be taken, the first one after 6 months and the second after 9 months of sowing.
        Post-harvest Management: After harvesting, the whole plant is dried in shade. At this stage, light threshing will separate the seeds, which can be used for the next sowing. The leaves and stems are also then separately collected.
        Overview. Madagascar periwinkle is a plant. The parts that grow above the ground and the root are used to make medicine. Madagascar periwinkle is used for diabetes, cancer, sore throat, cough, insect bite, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>native of Madagarcas, it is common throughout India. It is an evergreen herb or an herbaceous under shrub, quite hardy, biennial or short lived perennial, up to 3 ft height. The stems are green, silky, and glossy with latex. Leaves are simple, oval, oblong or obovate and opposite in position.
        Periwinkle prefers shade but will grow well in full sun. The foliage color is richer green in partial shade, but more flowers are produced in the sun. Rooted cuttings or established plants are normally spaced from 12 to 18 inches apart. At a 6-inch spacing periwinkle will completely cover an area in one year.
