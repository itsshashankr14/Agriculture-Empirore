    <h1>Sunflower</h1>

    <img src="https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/agriculture/CropProduction/Oilseeds/sunflower/tnauCo2hybrid.jpg">
    <h2>Introdution</h2>
    <p>Sunflower should be sowed by the end of January. If you are sowing it in February, do not use seeds, as it may
        reduce yield. Use transplanting technique.

        Seed spacing
        Plant to plant distance is 30 cm.

        Row to row distance is 60 cm.

        Sow seeds 4-5 cm deep.

        Seed rate is 2-3 kg/acre. For hybrid, it is 2.2.5 kg/acre.
    </p>

    <p>Sunflower is an annual plant, that grows with big, daisylike flower. It is tall and course, has creeping or
        tuberous roots and large, bristly leaves. Some sunflower varieties grow to over 16 feet in height while the
        dwarf varieties thrive well in small spaces and containers.
        Most sunflowers are heat and drought tolerant. They also make excellent cut flowers and are loved by the bees
        and birds. The common giant sunflower is useful as a screen, against the hedge or a wall. The miniature
        sunflowers are small growing and are useful for cultivation in mixed borders and for cut flowers.
        Sunflowers are easy to culture and not very fastidious regarding soil, but they do need abundant sunlight and
        air.
        Sunflowers prefer direct sunlight i.e. 6 - 8 hours/day. They flower well during long, hot summers.
        Sunflowers prefer well-dug, loose, well-draining soil as they have long taproots which need to stretch out .
        For preparing a bed, dig 2 feet in depth and about 3 feet across to ensure that the soil isn’t compact.
        Choose a well-drained location, and prepare your soil by digging about 2-3 feet in circumference and 2 feet
        deep.
        Sunflowers are not too fussy, but they thrive well in soil with the pH value 6.0 - 7.5.
        These gorgeous flowers are heavy feeders, thus the soil needs to be enriched with organic matter or compost
        manure</p>

    <h2> Diseases:</h2>
    <img src="https://morningchores.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sunflower-disease-800x533.jpg">
    <p>->Birds and squirrels will show interest in the seeds. if you plan to use the seeds, deter critters with barrier
        devices. As seed heads mature and flowers droop, you can cover each one with white polyspun garden fleece.
        Sunflowers are relatively insect-free. A small gray moth sometimes lays its eggs in the blossoms. Pick the worms
        from the plants.
        ->Downy mildew, rust, and powdery mildew can also affect the plants. If fungal diseases are spotted early, spray
        with a general garden fungicide.
    </p>


    <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
    <p>Sunflower grows well on neutral to moderately alkaline soils, with a range of pH 6.5 – 8.0, but dislikes acid
        conditions. Wild varieties are tolerant of poor drainage but cultivated varieties are unsuited to such
        conditions, which increase susceptibility to fungal disease and lodging from lack of support. </p>
    Sunflower grows happily in sandy loam soils and also black soils. The soils should be well-drained and fertile. The
    crop can also withstand slightly alkaline soils. Please do not sow in acidic soils.

    Soil pH should be between 6.5 and 8.0.

    Soil preparation
    About 2-3 ploughings are needed to prepare fine tilth soil.
    Sunflower performs well on a wide range of soils such as sandy loams, black
    soils and alluviums. Never the less, it does best in fertile, well drained neutral
    soils.
    Sunflower is more susceptible to high moistness and soil compaction.
    During rabi season it is grown in moisture retentive soils of vertisols.
    PH of 6.5 to 8.0 is ideal for its cultivation.
    It can tolerate slight alkaline conditions but not acidity.
    Water logging areas should be avoided, adequate drainage is a must.
    Poor drainage conditions are unsuited because it increases susceptibility to fungal
    diseases.
    An Exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 16 cause delayed germination
    and less development of flower heads.</p>

    <p>Sunflower is a short-day plant with a variable response to daylength, but day-neutral varieties exist. The crop
        is mainly grown under rainfed conditions on a wide range of soils. Under erratic and low rainfall, a rather deep
        soil with good water holding capacity is required.It is an important oilseed crop grown in kharif and rabi
        seasons across the country. Sunflower is an important edible oil being imported in large quantity.</p>
    The crop requires a cool climate during germination and seedling stage.
    Warm weather from seedling up to flowering.
    Non cloudy sunny days from flowering to maturity.
    High humidity together with cloudy weather and rainfall at the time of flowering
    results in poor seed set.
    The amount of linoleic acid decreases with high temperature at maturity.
    The seasonal rainfall requirement for a good crop of sunflower is about 500 mm.
    Sunflower is a photo insensitive crop. So it can be grown in any season.
    The ideal conditions for best sunflower production are that
    Kharif: Flowering period should not coincide with continuous rains/drizzle.
    Summer: Temperature during flowering should not exceed 38 to 40 oC.
    Optimum temperature during growing period: 20 to 25 oC
    </p>
    <h2> Water Supply </h2>
    <img
        src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/v1638892556/EducationHub/photos/sunflower-irrigation.jpg">
    <p>The water requirements of sunflower vary from 600 to 1000 mm, depending on climate and length of total growing
        period. Evapotranspiration increases from establishment to flowering, and can be as high as 12 to 15 mm/day.
        High evapotranspiration rates are maintained during seed setting and early ripening period.
        Regulate irrigation according to the following growth phase. Irrigate immediately after sowing followed by an
        irrigation on 4 - 5th day and later at intervals of 7 to 8 days according to soil and climatic conditions,
        seeding,
        flowering and seed development stage (ie) two weeks before and after flowering.
        Between 500 and 750 mm of rain, and some of this may be stored soil moisture, evenly spread over the growing
        period
        and ceasing just before main flowering and seed filling, will normally produce excellent crops.
        Sunflowers are sun worshipers that grow best in spots that get six to eight hours of direct sun per day. They
        have
        long tap roots that need to go several feet into the ground, so sunflower plants prefer loose, well-drained,
        somewhat alkaline soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5.</p>
    <h2> Harvesting </h2>
    <img
        src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/lacheev/lacheev2006/lacheev200600503/149885398-harvester-sunflower-harvesting-sunflower-in-a-field-by-a-combine-harvester-in-the-fall.jpg">
    <p>Once your sunflowers have died back completely and the backs of the blooms are brown, it's time to harvest.
        You'll also notice the seeds are plump and somewhat loose. Cut the stalk with sharp scissors or pruners, about
        one foot down from the flower head, and place in a container that can catch any loose seeds.
        The sunflower crop matures in 90-100 days. The crop has to be harvested when the lower side of the head turns
        yellow
        and some of the bracts dry up.
        It’s best to wait and let the seeds dry completely on the stem. Then, just cut the stem a inch below the heads.
        But some folks want to beat the critters and dry indoors. In this case, cut the stalks about a foot below the
        heads when the outer seeds are mature and hang the heads upside down a warm, dry place that is well-ventilated
        and protected from rodents and insects. Keep the heads covered as described above.

        When the seeds are thoroughly dried (after a few weeks), dislodge them by rubbing two heads together, or by
        rubbing the seeds with your hand or by using a stiff brush. Dislodge them over a big bucket. Allow the seeds to
        dry overnight on a paper towel.</p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Despite this, 5 states have maintained the area under sunflower production. Statistics of the Ministry of
        Agriculture show that farmers of Karnataka, Odisha, Haryana, Maharashtra and Bihar take a lot of interest in
        sunflower cultivation. These states are getting 75% of the total production
