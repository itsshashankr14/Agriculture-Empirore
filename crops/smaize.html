It is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because of its highest genetic yield potential.</p>

        <p>Augments Eye Health, Supplies Essential Amino Acids, Supports A Gluten-Free Diet,Fortifies Bone Density, Keeps Blood Sugar Levels In Check, Treats Anaemia, Boosts Nervous System Function and

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Maize</h2>
            <img src="">
            <p>In India, maize is traditionally grown in monsoon (Kharif) season, which is accompanied by high temperature (35Â° C) and rainfall. However, with the development of new cultivars and appropriate production technology, winter cultivation of maize has emerged as a viable alternative.
                Maize can be grown successfully in variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam. However, soils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are 7 considered good for higher productivity.</p>
                
<h2> Water Supply for Maize</h2>
<img src="">
<p>Maize is quick, vigorous and tall growing crop having broad leaves , therefore its water requirement is exceptionally high. A vigorous growing maize plant requires about 2-3 litres of water per day during peak growing period or an average consumptive use of water varies from 2.5 to 4.3 mm/day.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Maize</h2>

    <p>Harvesting Season of Maize
        Seasons of Maize Kharif are in June to July and August and harvested in December. These are the maize cropping season in India. The major states for Kharif corn farming in India are Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Among Indian states Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka has highest area under maize (15% each) followed by Maharashtra (10%), Rajasthan (9%), Uttar Pradesh (8%) and others. After Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh Bihar is the highest maize producer.</p>
