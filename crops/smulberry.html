    <h2>Introdution of Mulberry</h2>
    <p>Mulberry is known in India as "Kalpa Vruksha" as all the parts of the plant have many uses.Morus, a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae, consists of diverse species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries, growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions.</p>
        
        <h2>Health benefits of Mulerry</h2>
        <p>Mulberries may lower cholesterol levels, help prevent fatty liver disease, and improve blood sugar control. They also decrease oxidative stress, which may reduce cancer risk. </p></br>
            
            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Mulberry</h2>
            <p>The ideal temperature should be between 24 and 28oC with relative humidity of 65 to 80 percent and sun shine duration of 5 to 12 hours per day. Mulberry can be grown in a rainfall range of 600mm to 2500mm. Under low rainfall conditions, the growth is limited and requires supplemental irrigation.
                Everbearing mulberry trees prefer well-draining, moist, loamy soil with a pH between 5.5-7. However, they can also grow in sandy and clay soil. 
            </p>

<p>General Guidelines. Mulberry trees should receive at least 1 inch of water each week for optimal growth and fruit production. If you receive this amount of rainfall in your area each week, you won't need to use the hose. During dry spells, fruit may drop prematurely if irrigation is insufficient. </p>
    <h2> Harvesting of Mulberry</h2>

    <p>Harvest season begins mid-June thru August. Fruit will be large, sweet and black when fully ripe. You can hand pick or lay a sheet or tarp under the mulberry tree and shake the branch gently. Ripe berries will fall onto the sheet or tarp.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Though mulberry cultivation is practised in various climates, the major area is in theÂ tropical zone covering Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states, with about 90 percent. In the sub-tropical zone, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and the northeastern states have major areas under mulberry cultivation.</p>
