    <h2>Introdution of Sorghum</h2>
    <p>Sorghum is considered an ancient grain. The earliest known records of sorghum were found at an archaeological dig in northeastern Africa near the Egyptian-Sudanese border and date back to 8000 B.C. Sorghum grows well even in arid climates, which is probably why it spread across Africa.Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) includes widely diverse types of annual and perennial types. Sorghum grain is the fifth most important cereal in the world. The crop is a heat and drought tolerant, dryland-adapted crop that is generally grown in marginal crop production areas.</p>

        <h2>Health benefits of Sorghum</h2>
        <p>Sorghum is known to be rich in phenolic compounds, many of which act as antioxidants. It has also been shown to be good at reducing some forms of inflammation due to its antioxidant properties. Several of the phenolic compounds in sorghum have been linked to anti-cancer effects.</p></br>

            <h2>Climate and Soil Requirement  for Sorghum</h2>
            <p>It is generally grown between 40oNorth and 40o South of the equator, in warm and hot countries characteristic of the semi-arid environment. Sorghum requires warm conditions but it can be grown under a wide range of conditions.
                Sorghum can be grown successfully on clay, clay loam, or sandy loam soils. Fertile, well-drained soils are important to optimize yield. Soils with clay loam or loam texture, having good water retention capacity are best suited for sorghum cultivation.

<h2> Water Supply for Sorghum</h2>

<p>Irrigation should not be delayed for more than 24 hours after cutting. Irrigate on 3rd or 4th day after cutting. Subsequently irrigate once in 7 - 10 days. Stop irrigation on 70 - 80 days after ratooning.</p>
    <h2> Harvestingn of Sorghum</h2>

    <p>Sorghum using row crop or sickle bar headers. Raise the header high enough to harvest only the grain heads with a minimum of leaves and stalks. Narrow row spacing helps to discourage lodging due to adjacent plants supporting broken stalks.</p>
    <h2>Location </h2>
    <p>Maharashtra & Karnataka account for 57.2% of Sorghum (Jowar) produced in India. MP, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, & Andhra Pradesh are the next major producers contributing 11.9%.</p>
